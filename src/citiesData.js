          The Sundarbans — the “beautiful forest” — sprawl into a delta where
          three legendary rivers of South Asia meet the Bay of Bengal. It is the
          largest and most complex mangrove ecosystem in the world, a tidal
          estuary half again larger than Florida’s Everglades.
        </p>

        <p>But the Sundarbans are in deep trouble.</p>

        <p>
          Dr. Krishna Ray and a determined team of young botanists she oversees
          are trying to rescue them. That’s not easy when surprisingly little is
          understood about precisely how these complicated swamps grow and
          thrive. Dr. Ray and her team are discovering what makes them tick.
          Hemendra Kotal, Chayan Giri and Anup Mandal are part of the team. All
          three grew up in West Bengal, the Indian state where the Sundarbans
          are located.
        </p>

        <p>
          Still, they come from distinctly different backgrounds. Anup grew up
          in a town where the Himalayan hills in the state’s north begin to give
          way to the alluvial plain that defines its south. Hemendra is from the
          mega-city of Kolkata, once British India’s colonial capital, upstream
          from the Sundarbans. Chayan was born and raised in the Sunderbans
          themselves, on the largest island among more than 100, facing the Bay
          of Bengal. They are in their mid-twenties, pursuing doctoral studies.
          Two other members of the team — Ranjan Pradhan and Subhra Kanti
          Tripathy — are locals from the village of Ramganga who help with the
          work.
        </p>

        <p>
          I tagged along with the group as they traveled the winding waterways
          by boat gathering samples of soil, water and the many varieties of
          mangrove plants. They pored over everything from the precise
          composition of plant species in each patch of mangrove they are
          restoring — Ceriops decandra versus Aegialitis rotundifolia,
          Xylocarpus mekongensis compared to Bruguiera gymnorrhiza — to the
          array of microbial bacteria inhabiting the soil deep below the
          surface. Dr. Ray toggled effortlessly on deck between encouraging her
          team of Ph.D. candidates and cajoling her project funders in the
          Indian government by mobile phone.

        <p>
          As distant as this meandering amalgam of islands and waterways can
          seem — even for many Indians and neighboring Bangladeshis, whose
          country takes in more than half of the delta — the region matters
          globally. Mangroves are impressive carbon storehouses, locking up
          millions of tons of the stuff both above and below ground. Like
          tropical rainforests, they are super-dense, intricate agglomerations
          of plants and animals — from legions of bacteria and armies of insects
          to the last 250 or so wild Royal Bengal tigers — so big their
          destruction would be felt far beyond their actual borders.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mangrove roots plunge deep into the waterlogged soil — a mix of clay,
          sand, and silt — holding it in place against powerful tidal ebbs and
          flows twice each day. Those same roots also rise back up from the soil
          surface in knobby protrusions the plants literally breathe through.
          Robust mangrove stands can buffer the increasingly intense cyclones
          that batter these shores beginning late spring and running through to
          the fall. They are also critical to managing the inexorable rise of
          the sea level itself, one of several climate change impacts wreaking
          havoc across the fragile ecosystem.
        </p>

        <p>
          Healthy mangroves function as a protective barrier for life above the
          waterline. This includes the more than four million Indians and three
          million Bangladeshis who inhabit this tenuous landscape. The area was
          very sparsely populated before the British colonial government began
          encouraging migration here in hopes of expanding its tax base and
          obtaining new forest resources to export.
        </p>

        <p>
          Population growth has exploded in the past half-century. Yet apart
          from some tourism, fishing, logging, and honey gathering, there’s
          virtually no large-scale economic activity. Everyone here suffers
          burdens of accelerating climate change, but they are falling most
          heavily on women, who are responsible for finding potable water and
          much of the work in rice paddies and fields, both increasingly
          difficult tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Distant as all this may seem, their struggles with climate change will
          become increasingly familiar to people everywhere. Their world is
          changing fast now, much faster than they have the resources or
          wherewithal to adapt to. They’re losing ground, in small but steady
          increments tide after tide, in larger chunks cyclone by cyclone. Four
          large storms have slammed into the area in the past three years,
          leaving scars across the interwoven land and seascape and its
          inhabitants reeling, humans and microbes alike.

        <p>
          This is the first of three dispatches on my visit to the Sundarbans.
        </p>

        <p>
          Regular readers will notice they are the first I’m focusing squarely
          on climate change impact, rather than energy transition. That’s been a
          deficiency of this space, since they’re really two sides of the same
          coin. The solutions to global warming — energy transition,
          restructuring our agricultural system, rethinking how we build things
          and live our lives — will only be possible if we also manage our way
          through the tumult caused by climate change itself in ways that
          maintain a modicum of stability. This will require resilience. So it’s
          worth a look at some communities, however removed from our own
          experience, fully in the throes of trying to develop this sort of
          resilience.
        </p>

        <p>
          They are harbingers of the profound challenges careening toward the
          rest of the world as global warming gains momentum. The longer we wait
          to eliminate the greenhouse gas emissions causing the climate to warm,
          the more our future will resemble their struggle to keep up with a
          rapidly changing world.
        </p>

        <p>
          The residents of the Sundarbans did nothing to cause climate change.
          Most didn’t even have electricity until a decade or so ago. Some still
          don’t. A minuscule few own cars. Yet if climate change is threatening
          to overwhelm the Sundarbans, humans are nonetheless doing plenty to
          help it. They dam and divert the rivers that spill down from the
          Himalayas and across the plains, diminishing the flow of fresh water
          from the north into the swampy delta. Meanwhile, they build ever
          higher berms and embankments on the Bay of Bengal to the south to try
          to keep the sea off the land, especially during storms. The
          embankments displace mangroves, often through misguidedly uprooting
          them during construction.
        </p>

        <p>
          The combination is a deadly challenge to complex mangrove ecosystems,
          which are what they are in part due to wide gradations in water and
          soil salinity. It’s the worst of both worlds for them, with humans
          literally uprooting them from one side and denying them the brackish
          water by blocking the fresh water flow from the rivers on the other.
        </p>

        <p>
          The result is a vicious cycle: degrading mangroves leave islands more
          exposed to rising sea levels and more frequent and forceful storms;
          that spurs the construction of more embankments, which makes it harder
          for mangroves to regain a foothold. The West Bengal state government
          now requires 50 meters of shoreline in front of embankments, but in
          practice, the barriers usually wind up being built right at the
          water’s edge or the land in front of them erodes away. The result is
          mile upon mile of embankments lining river banks denuded of mangrove.
        </p>

          alt=" by Bill Spindle"
        />

        <p>
          This is the cycle Dr. Ray and her teams are seeking to break — by
          figuring out how to help the mangroves grow back.
        </p>

        <p>
          It turns out to be harder than just re-planting. They’re puzzling out
          why, finding ways to turn barren stretches of river bank back into
          robust mangrove habitat. My trip with them was one of dozens they make
          each year.
        </p>

        <p>
          A key, they have found, is grasses. Grasses are found only sparsely in
          fully developed mangrove stands. But Dr. Ray and her team have
          discovered they play a critical role in helping mangroves gain new
          footholds where they have lost their grip on the shifting mud flats.
          Once grasses are established, the mangrove seedlings nestle into the
          grassy tangle. There they can grow, protected from being washed away
          in the intense, twice-daily tidal currents.
        </p>

        <p>
          So Dr. Ray and her team start not with the mangroves, but rather more
          humbly — with the grasses. Where it works, this breaks the vicious
          cycle. Grasses give way to the growth of various mangroves that like
          the salty seawater at the shoreline. As silt and sand build around
          those, nurturing them further, the salinity levels in the soil drop,
          and other less-salt water-loving mangrove species take hold.
          Eventually, the collective habitat begins to resemble the robust
          stands that existed before and still survive in less populated, more
          protected parts of the Sundarbans.
        </p>
        <p>
          In total, the 31 plots her team is restoring add up to less than a
          quarter of a mile square, scattered about the inhabited parts of a
          wetland that covers 3,800 square miles. She hopes to expand to many
          more sites as they refine their work
        </p>
        <p>
          This will take years, if not decades, and lots of replanting and
          nurturing by Dr. Ray’s team and local villagers they enlist in the
          effort. Some parts may never grow back the same. Ray and her team have
          been trying to reestablish a species of mangrove known as Sundari — a
          variety once so dominant that some believe it’s where the name of the
          region comes from. Sundari have very little salt tolerance, so
          struggle to grow in the saltier soils that now dominate the
          Sundarbans.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We planted more than six thousand seedlings, but we failed,” says Dr.
          Ray, undeterred. “Now with the monsoon rains the salinity of the soil
          has dropped and we’ll try again.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Where they have had success, the end result is a village protected by
          an embankment that is shielded by a buffer of mangroves. The
          combination, where it exists, has stood up against even the strongest
          storms so far. From there the mangroves can grow and spread, as they
          have here for thousands of years.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Where we plant and what we plant is important. We have to study them
          first,” says Anup. “A forest can only be defined by multiple species.”
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of our four-day journey through the Sundarbans, Dr. Ray and
          her team puzzled over something they noticed: a particular bacteria
          exists in far lower concentrations in pristine areas of the wetland
          where they have taken samples, compared to the areas they have under
          restoration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, the more developed the restoration, the lower the
          concentration is of this particular microbe in the soil.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We’re looking closely at this,” Dr. Ray asks her team. “Why is this?”

        <p>
          War in Ukraine rages. Markets roil. Inflation has spiked. New waves of
          Covid gain deadly momentum, especially in China, the country with the
          world’s largest population and second largest economy. Worries abound.
        </p>

        <p>
          Still, the need to address global warming remains more urgent than
          ever, even if tempting to place on a backburner. We still need to push
          forward with climate solutions, multitasking our way through a
          plethora of emergencies competing for our attention, many caused in
          part or worsened by climate change itself. One only need to read the
          news, albeit now on the inside pages, sidebar scrolls and
          off-prime-time broadcasts, to be reminded of this urgency.
        </p>

        <p>
          So I’m forging ahead here with the second of three posts on my visit
          to the Indian Sundarbans (the first). Here the war in Ukraine seems
          distant, while the ravages of global warming present immediate
          challenges each day. Bricks and sandbags accumulate in every village
          this time of year, as the annual reinforcement of homes and river
          embankments against cyclones takes place. It’s one of the many
          practices that once provided a measure of protection against rising
          waters but are now increasingly found wanting in the face of the more
          frequent and powerful storms global warming generates.
        </p>

        <p>
          So far in this newsletter, we’ve visited a tiny, cattle-fueled biogas
          facility serving a school (this earlier post) and a mangrove
          restoration initiative by a curious botanist (my last post, as also
          linked above). Here we look at a community resilience-building
          initiative started by a village-born kid turned international IT
          consultant who is now helping back home.
        </p>

        <p>
          These small efforts may seem insignificant in the face of war in
          Europe, much less the sheer scale of the climate challenge. Each
          alone, they are. But small-scale, local initiatives such as these, in
          aggregate and across the world are just as essential to adapting to
          global warming and pushing towards solutions as the mega-projects I’ll
          look at later in the journey.
        </p>

        <p>
          In a way, the mega-scale undertakings needed to arrest climate change
          — transitioning away from fossil fuels and overhauling agriculture to
          eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, to name the most urgent — will
          happen only on foundations laid by local climate adaptation efforts.
          They’re what will help communities maintain the wherewithal to take on
          the big changes ahead.
        </p>

        <p>
          Few understand change better than inhabitants of the Sundarbans.
          Theirs is a world of shifting land, tidal surges and furious cyclones.
          They know how to adapt. Yet today they find it ever harder to keep up
          with the pace of climate change.

        <p>
          Sankar Halder grew up here, in the tiny village of Purba Shridharpur.
          As a kid, his smarts caught the attention of a teacher who helped him
          get into a better school in the city of Kolkata a few hours train ride
          away. His village pulled together to help his family pay. He
          eventually joined the budding field of information technology, landed
          a job at one of India’s top IT consultancies and worked for a decade
          and a half in the U.S. and Australia. Then he returned to India.
        </p>
        <p>
          Halder, 48, lives in Kolkata now with his wife and two teenage
          daughters. But he spends a lot of time back in Purba Shridharpur.
          There he runs Mukti, a private nonprofit organization aiming to build
          a kind of community resilience he hopes can stand up to the ravages of
          climate change even in the Sundarbans, one of the most vulnerable
          places on the planet. Gradually he’s expanding the approach across the
          state of West Bengal and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
          Born under a thatch roof, educated in a big city, internationalized
          while working abroad, Halder still says of Purba Shridharpur, “This is
          my home.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He’s one of millions of local leaders around the world trying to help
          their communities become more resilient to the impacts of a rapidly
          changing climate. Tens if not hundreds of millions more will be
          necessary. They’re needed not just to help communities adapt to the
          fallout of global warming. The resilience they foster also bolsters
          community capacity to take on the often equally disruptive changes
          required to decarbonize our way of life, whether that’s overhauling
          agriculture or how we produce and consume energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Communities put off those changes if they’re forever trying recover
          from one crisis and bracing for the next — which is increasingly what
          life in the Sunderbans looks like. This vicious cycle will
          characterize life in many more places as the impacts of global warming
          gain momentum, which they inexorably will until worldwide emissions of
          greenhouse gases net out at zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mukti, which means “freedom” in Bengali, does many things: provides
          jobs, makes small loans to entrepreneurial women, promotes sustainable
          agriculture, and works on health care and sanitation. Its housing
          initiative epitomizes Halder’s approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine a house built not only to stand up, but even more expressly to
          stay down — anchored to the ground against the strongest winds and
          rushing floodwaters cyclones can muster. It’s a home, but also a place
          where a family could shelter during a cyclone. After withstanding a
          storm, it’s back to being a home again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Actually, you don’t have to imagine. Here’s what it looks like, one of
          three prototype houses Mukti is constructing for 100 families in the
          pilot phase of the initiative…
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          The homes are a model for more than just housing. They embody a
          community-based, government-backed, privately-run ethos, paid for
          mostly with a blend of government and Mukti funds (which largely come
          from corporate social responsibility funds and charitable
          contributions). Buyers put up about 20% of the roughly $3,500 cost of
          a house in cash, and sometimes their own labor.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We say, ‘We’ll build you a durable, flood-tolerant home. Why don’t
          you spend some time helping build the community?’” says Halder. “We
          don’t give anything for free. You have to work for it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The homestead initiative even has an element of international
          cooperation. The houses are designed by Laurent Fournier, a French
          architect based in Kolkata who has developed a specialization in
          affordable, cyclone-resistant, flood-tolerant housing.
        </p>

        <p>
          The homes use traditional local materials such as jute plant, bamboo
          and thatch, combined with some concrete, tin and even chicken wire for
          added strength. The roof support system is based on the same
          principles as a Japanese parasol, which stands out in this photo of
          the upper floor.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          Yet if the housing embodies Halder’s vision, education is the key to
          realizing it, he says. That’s why one of Mukti’s biggest initiatives
          provides supplementary schooling for more than 6,000 elementary,
          middle, and high school students at 52 locations. Kids chosen for
          Mukti’s supplemental classes arrive at school at 6 am, three hours
          before the start of the regular school day, which they then attend as
          well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Supplemental schooling is critical for children who often attend
          failing public schools with hundreds of students per teacher. But it
          is one of the first things to go when poor families lose their income,
          simply because they don’t have other non-essential expenses to cut.
          This leaves these communities even more vulnerable over the long haul,
          unable to escape from round after round of repeated disaster. With
          education, villagers will better grasp the challenges, develop better
          capability to address them, and learn the skills necessary to thrive
          elsewhere if they’re overwhelmed in the end and have to move.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Whatever the situation becomes, we have to keep our education up and
          running. Without that we cannot break this cycle.” says Halder
        </p>
        <p>And climate change?</p>
        <p>
          “Climate and environment cut across it all. Agriculture has to be
          climate resilient. Your health needs to be. Your livelihood. Your
          housing,” he told me as we sipped tea on a cool morning in his garden,
          down the dirt road from Mukti’s main headquarters near the village.
          “Whatever the economic or development initiative, it has to be climate
          resilient, especially in this region, or it doesn’t make any sense. We
          can do many things, but overnight a cyclone can come along and destroy
          everything.”

        <p>
          I had zig-zagged through the Sundarbans for five days, from the
          populated western side to the wildlife reserve in the east and then
          half way back, before I finally reached a pair of islands located
          where the Ganges River meets the Bay of Bengal.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here I met Sourav Giri, who had agreed to be my guide to the islands
          of Ghoramara and Gangasagar. We greeted each other after my car pulled
          into what’s known by its map coordinates as Lot 8. This is where the
          ferries depart from.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had explained to Sourav that my mission was to report on the impacts
          of climate change. Within minutes of setting off toward the first of
          these islands, the bright, energetic 32-year-old — a guy who taught
          himself to speak English by conversing alone in front of a mirror —
          was exclaiming to me, “Who will save us?”
        </p>

        <p>
          He was exclaiming, rather than asking, because when it comes to the
          dwindling population of Ghoramara, it is too late for saving.
        </p>

        <p>
          Getting this far in my Sundarbans journey had already been an
          adventure. Five days earlier I had bumped along potholed and buckling
          roads from the nearest big city, Kolkata (once known as Calcutta).
          Three days aboard a boat with a team of researchers transported me
          across the Sundarbans. Another five-hour jostling car ride and I was
          in the village of Purba Shridharpur, where I saw how everything from
          housing to education helps build climate resilience.
        </p>

        <img

        <p>
          Along the way were stretches of pristine mangroves as far as one could
          see, as well as many miles of eroded shoreline lacking almost any
          vegetation. On one morning, a crocodile longer than I am tall lumbered
          off a landing as our boat pulled up so we could, very carefully,
          disembark at the river bank. At another landing a billboard welcomed
          us with a warning about a rogues gallery of snakes, from king cobras
          to constrictors.

        <p>
          Just a few days before I arrived in a town called Raidighi, wildlife
          authorities trapped a Bengal tiger. The tiger was returned to the
          reserve — a development villagers were still relating with relief when
          I showed up. Another day we came across this guy below, hand-catching
          mudskippers deep in the oozy, denuded river bank. They look like a
          cross between a fish and a salamander.
        </p>

        <p>
          And on yet another day, wandering with my botanist guides through
          undisturbed forest, I looked up in wonder to see more bees than I’d
          ever been around in my life. Their buzzing filled the air as they
          weaved in and out of a tangle of flowers in a Nim tree (a.k.a. Indian
          Lilac or, scientifically, Azadirachta indica, as my botanist guides
          informed me). This is the rich density of life the Sundarbans is known
          for.
        </p>

        />

        <p>
          But I also saw plenty of devastation, particularly from May 2020’s
          Cyclone Amphan — which served up terrific, record-setting wind gusts —
          and May 2021’s Cyclone Yaas, which delivered an unprecedented storm
          surge when it arrived during an unusually high tide. Collapsed homes,
          washed-out shoreline embankments, rice paddy fields wasting from
          saltwater inundation — the damage to villages was obvious. Fallen
          trees littered even the thickest and healthiest mangrove stands.
        </p>

        <p>Yet none of this prepared me for Ghoramara and Gangasagar.</p>

        <p>
          If the Sundarbans are among the increasing number of places on earth
          facing an existential threat from climate change, Ghoramara Island has
          reached a point of no return. Nearby Gangasagar doesn’t seem too far
          behind. These are alarming, happening-right-now reminders that the
          cascading challenges of global warming can overwhelm — at first
          slowly, then all at once as they say — even communities well
          accustomed to these sorts of hazards.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s not as if Anil Ghorai, 50, had never been through a cyclone. Born
          on Ghoramara, he was one of dozens of residents we spoke with during
          our visit. The island has lost more than half its area to erosion and
          flooding and three-quarters of its population to migration in the past
          decade or so. One of a few thousand remaining island residents, Ghorai
          saw his home destroyed by winds during Amphan. He had just finished
          rebuilding last year when Cyclone Yaas brought catastrophic flooding.
        </p>

        <p>“Nature didn’t give me time to recover,” he told us.</p>

        <p>
          He extended his arm in a sort of hook-shape, describing how he
          clutched a tree during Yaas, holding tight with his other hand to a
          tin box with his all his savings and irreplaceable documents. Water
          poured over the embankments and swept his newly rebuilt house away.
          His wife, a baby son in her arms, scrambled to the top of a pile of
          bricks left over from the construction to stay above the rising water.
        </p>

        <p>
          “I could never have imagined the entire island going under,” he said,
          standing next to his once-again destroyed home.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yet it did, miraculously leaving not a villager dead during the storm
          itself. Most sheltered on the upper floor of the local school. Here’s
          Sourav showing how high the floodwaters crested at the center of the
          island, just inches below the floor where residents were sheltering...
        </p>

        <img
          src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84a46cd7-7568-4963-804e-17e2b4e55352_4032x3024.jpeg"

        />

        <p>
          Property, homes, material livelihoods — all wiped out, along with
          virtually every living thing on the island that couldn’t swim or fly
          to safety. “Cows, hens, goats, all the animals died,” one resident
          told us.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, too, did the possibility of growing rice or cultivating the betel
          leaf that many on the island grew to supplement their income. School
          textbooks and student records were ruined. For two days, there was no
          drinking water beyond what residents had in the shelter. Emergency
          food supplies took even longer to arrive.
        </p>

        <p>
          “We lost everything,” said Sheikh Sabir, a 24-year-old we met beside a
          pond where he repeatedly threw a net into the water hoping to come up
          with a few fish to help feed his wife, seven-month-old daughter,
          parents, and uncle. Very few fish survive in the once fresh water —
          what locals call “sweetwater” — that dot the island and are now
          markedly saline. He’d caught nothing so far that day.
        </p>

        <p>
          “What will happen next?” he ponders upon being asked. “If the
          government gives us land, we’ll move away.”
        </p>

        <img

          alt=" by Bill Spindle"
        />

        <p>
          Large swathes of the island are now wastelands of infertile soil or
          shoreline that routinely breaks off and dissolves into the water
          flowing past relentlessly. These powerful tidal currents reverse twice
          each day, rushing in and draining out, undermining shoreline
          embankments awaiting the next cyclone.
        </p>

        <p>
          It reminded me of what a program manager at a nonprofit group told me
          earlier in the week. The group, known as the Tagore Society, does a
          wide variety of social and environmental work in the Sundarbans.
        </p>

            “You cannot fight against nature. Nature will fight back. That’s

            has to consider environmental factors because to make a sustainable
            livelihood here is very difficult. Whatever you’ve accomplished in
            two to three years, or even five years or ten years — all of a
            sudden a cyclone comes along and it is finished.”
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Yet moving is no simple task, either.</p>

        <p>
          The government won’t provide land elsewhere. But it is building
          housing on Gangasagar for the most vulnerable residents who can no
          longer scrape out a life on Ghoramara. Thirty families will take up
          the offer this year, adding to a growing community of Ghoramara
          residents who have abandoned the island, according to Sudipta Mondal,
          a local government development official on the bigger island.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mondal is justifiably proud of the government’s record of preventing
          deaths during such big storms. Not long ago, less powerful cyclones
          killed thousands, even tens of thousands. The improvement comes from
          building shelters for even the poorest communities, convincing
          villagers to use them, and using modern meteorology to accurately
          predict where and when cyclones will hit.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yet for the residents of smaller islands like Ghoramara, the only
          long-term alternative remains leaving, Mondal said.
        </p>

        <p>
          “They’re accustomed to having their own land,” he said, “but there’s
          no choice.”
        </p>

        <p>Many, especially the young, move further away than Gangasagar.</p>

        <p>
          We stopped for tea at the shop of Kanai Lal Guchhait. The 64-year-old
          and his wife earn less than 50 cents a day selling tea and biscuits
          now, a fraction of what they made before much of the population,
          especially the working-age men, moved away.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cyclone Ampham wiped out Guchhait’s betel leaf patch. Yaas stopped the
          plants from growing back. His son moved to north India after Amphan.
          After Yaas, his daughter and her husband moved there, as well. Both
          work in food processing factories. A granddaughter remains with
          Guchhait and his wife to attend school.
        </p>
        <p>
          The parents need money from their children to make ends meet. Their
          government-provided monthly food allotment — a little over five pounds
          each of wheat and lentils — lasts only about ten days. Still, they
          resist leaving themselves. Even if a home were offered to them on
          Gangasagar, they would have no space for a tea shop. Guchhait still
          holds out hope his empty dirt plot nearby will once again grow betel
          leaf.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Gangasagar, a far larger island with a population of some 150,000,
          has many challenges of its own. Not least is a huge Hindu festival
          held there each January. Over a span of about two weeks, as many as
          four million pilgrims — yes, you read that right, more than 25 times
          the population of the island — make their way to Gangasager. They
          cross the water on fleets of ferries brought in especially for the
          purpose, operating twenty-four-seven to deliver them to shores
          purpose-dredged for landings at high tide, low tide and everything in
          between.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pilgrims, some annual attendees, others on a once-a-lifetime
          journey of faith, file down to a beach facing the Bay of Bengal to
          purify themselves in the waters. Why they do this here is a fiery tale
          of sin and absolution. Suffice it to say, this is where, in Hindu
          mythology, the gentle and holy waters of the Ganges find the sea after
          gushing from the big toe of Vishnu and then are tamed by falling
          through the matted hair of Shiva — a journey thus involving Hinduism’s
          top two deities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Economically, spiritually, even politically, the festival is too
          important to the island, the state of West Bengal, India’s
          Hindu-nationalist government and the pilgrims themselves to even
          contemplate forgoing or moving the essential dip elsewhere. Yet the
          beach continues to erode away, pounded by some of the fastest-rising
          sea levels in the world. The Kapil Muni Ashram, closely associated
          with the festival, has been moved at least four, and maybe as many as
          seven, times over the past century or so — depending on who you ask —
          to stay ahead of the rising water. It flooded again during Yaas, less
          than a decade after the last move.
        </p>
        <p>
          State and local government and religious foundations have spent
          millions to build infrastructure in the area to handle the crowds. Now
          the local development authority is proposing to spend millions more
          for a barrier made up of thousands of huge concrete “pentapods”
          dropped offshore it hopes of diminishing the wave force and slowing
          the erosion. Neither natural mangrove barriers or the usual man-made
          embankments used to hold back the water can work here, with so many
          pilgrims needing access to the sea in such a short time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here’s a view of Kapil Muni Ashram when I was there. You can see how
          far it is from the beach, which was at my back when I took this photo…

        <p>
          Throughout my three days on the islands, Sourav provided running
          commentary, veering from explanation to interpretation to personal
          observations about everything from geopolitics to linguistics and tea.
          At turns amusing, animated and sad, frequently frustrated but never
          defeated, he had come a long way and was determined to go further. And
          he wanted me to know it.
        </p>
        <p>
          His father, a farmer, ran a tea stall during the festival. Yet Sourav
          himself had gotten an education, a masters degree. For years that
          meant arduous weekly ferry and train journeys to Kolkata and back,
          leaving at 2 am and returning home well into the evening.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I am the first in my family to cultivate my mind instead of
          cultivating crops,” he told me with pride.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had many motivational aphorisms to live by: “To be born poor, that
          is not a sin. To die poor, that is a sin,” he announced as we chugged
          across Ghoramara island in a three-wheeled tuk-tuk. “You have to
          change your own life. Nobody is here to help you,” he offered later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unprompted he began acting out his method for teaching himself
          English: hours of staccato, self-conversation before a mirror, his
          best friend growing up, he said.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “What is your name, sir?” <br></br>“My name is Sourav.”
            <br></br>“Where are you from, sir?”
            <br></br>“I am from Gangasagar.”
            <br></br>“What is your name?”
            <br></br>“What is your age?”
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>“Quite difficult,” he told me.</p>
        <p>
          Now an English tutor to the children of many of Gangasagar’s elite, he
          pulled out his phone to play me instructional Youtube videos he’s
          recorded. In them, he patiently explains the shades of meanings
          between words such as “fresh” (as in fruit) and “raw” (as in meat), or
          when to use “clean,” as opposed to “disinfect” or “sanitize.”
        </p>
        <p>
          As we sat beside an eroded grotty shoreline waiting for the ferry to
          take us off Ghoramara Island, he rattled off the names of India Nobel
          prize laureates, and launched into recitations of English poems he’d
          memorized, including by his favorite poet, William Wordsworth. The
          lines seemed wildly incongruous as we sat on the garbage-strewn shore.
          And yet somehow right on the mark.
        </p>
        <p>He closed his eyes to try to better call up the words…</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Behold her, single in the field,
            <br></br>Yon solitary Highland Lass!
            <br></br>Reaping and singing by herself;
            <br></br>Stop here or gently pass!
            <br></br>Alone she cuts and binds the grain,
            <br></br>And sings a melancholy strain;
            <br></br>O Listen! For the Vale profound
            <br></br>Is overflowing with the sound.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>There he stopped, unable to remember more.</p>

        <p>
          Readers of an energy and climate blog may not need reminding, but I
          beg your indulgence to use this post to do it anyway: the stakes of
          the decisions we’re collectively making on these issues could not be
          higher these days.
        </p>

        <p>
          This hit home for me in triplicate during a stop in India’s
          northeastern state of Manipur. I stayed in the main city, Imphal,
          making excursions into the surrounding countryside. Each made a deep
          impression.
        </p>

        <img

        <p>
          The first outing underscored the ways electricity, even a little bit
          of it, can change the lives of the poor and energy deprived. This is
          the heart of the energy challenge for economically developing
          countries like India, and many even-poorer countries across Asia,
          Africa, and Latin America.
        </p>

        <p>
          I bumped and bounced for five hours in the back seat of a jeep,
          winding deep into the hills beyond Imphal to visit the tiny village of
          Leisang. Leisang happens to be the final village in India to
          officially be electrified, back in 2018. Electricity arrived as part
          of a government drive to grid connect all of India — a country that,
          when I visited for the first time back in 2004, had hundreds of
          millions of people with no electricity at all.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prime Minister Narendra Modi made rural electrification a priority
          when he came to power in 2014. His government gave itself a big pat on
          the back when Leisang connected, hosting a high-profile press
          conference to get the word out.
        </p>

        <img

          alt="Chief Tongsat Haokip where the village connects to the grid.  by Bill Spindle"
        />

        <p>
          The 40 or so villagers of Leisang, a clan from a tribal group known as
          the Kuki, were of course also thrilled. Chief Tongsat Haokip told me
          how he hosted all the adults and many of their children for the big
          event at his home. The switch was flipped, a light went on and the
          villagers cheered and danced for hours. They were surprised by the
          flood of national press that suddenly showed up when the government
          made its announcement, without letting the villagers know in advance.
        </p>

        <p>
          From the moment that bulb lit up, they no longer had to simply dream —
          of their children being able to study after dark, of not having to
          cook by open wood fire inside their home (a terrible health hazard),
          of televisions and of not having to travel a half mile down the
          mountain to charge their mobile phones.
        </p>

        <p>Much of that has come to pass.</p>
        <p>
          “We’re used to the electricity now. Everybody is happy when it’s on,”
          Meena Rai, a 36-year-old mother of five told me as she showed off her
          electric burner.
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0fe838f-85e3-4cf7-85a6-c86e48a969be_4032x3024.jpeg"
          alt="Meena Rai with electric appliances.  by Bill Spindle"
        />
        <p>
          The operative phrase there is, “when it’s on,” of course. As her
          caveat implies, the reality of electrification still hasn’t met the
          hype, to be sure. When I visited, the power had been out for several
          days, a common problem for Leisang and, frankly, just about every
          Indian in a country still unable to deliver consistent power. This
          spring and summer have been especially bad for power outages, amid
          soaring demand, tight supplies, and tangled transportation lines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet even inconsistent access to electricity is changing the lives of
          these villagers, who scrape out an existence growing potatoes and yams
          in the hillsides surrounding their roughly 20 dirt-floored homes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chief Tongsat invested in a television first. Recently, he purchased
          an electric clothes washing machine. This has drastically cut down the
          number of hours his daughters-in-law spend pounding clothes by hand
          out back of the home to clean them. He paid a local car and driver
          service to cart the machine up the steep slope to the village and into
          his home, an interesting example of how the arrival of electricity can
          spur local economic activity even beyond those who directly use it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nearby, Rai now uses an electrical convection burner to cook for her
          five children, although she concedes she sometimes must revert to a
          wood fire when the power fails. She is grateful her kids can complete
          their homework most evenings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lives of Leisang villagers have not been wholly transformed. They
          have been magically empowered. Many of the villagers are still too
          poor to afford much more than a mobile phone. Yet they still felt they
          had been given a ticket to the modern world, even if it was only for
          the cheap seats. This made them hope for more — improved local
          healthcare, a school nearer by, better roads.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those things won’t come any easier than electricity. But every
          villager I talked to felt their lives had improved, and would continue
          to do so. This is what energy can do.

        <p>
          Another day, I visited Loktak Lake, part of a vast freshwater wetland
          that was once an incredibly diverse, globally unique ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          I visited a village here, too, this one much poorer than Leisang. No
          electricity at all here, just a few families that have lived for
          generations literally floating upon the water. Their homes are built
          on wooden rafts. They spend their days fishing and collecting the
          water plants they live off of and sell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their existential problem is for us a reminder that even in solving
          our carbon emissions challenges we can easily create new headaches:
          The delicate wetland has been all but ruined by a hydroelectric dam
          that came online in 1983.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Ithai Hydropower Dam was conceived and constructed with little
          environmental review or consideration for how it would affect the
          villagers and the local ecosystem. It flooded some 83,000 hectares of
          farmland and pasture — an area the size of New York City. Over time,
          this has caused what was essentially a very wide and shallow
          meandering river to stall and silt up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Invasive species have out-competed the native plants and animals in
          this new habitat, choking off the oxygen in the water that supports
          the fish and plant life villagers survive on.

          The poverty in the floating collection of homes — still reachable only
          by boat — was stark, even if the villagers were welcoming and sharing.
          They spoke of their difficulties and challenges getting the local
          government to address their concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          They’ve been fighting for decades to have the dam removed, with
          virtually no success. The state government isn’t listening. Indeed
          it’s planning a large-scale tourism push, including building hotels
          and running boats full of tourists on the lake. It is also planning
          more hydroelectric dams in the area, one way India is adding
          carbon-free energy, while also creating serious environmental
          concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          For me, this was a lesson in how important a considered and careful
          energy transition must be, even as it accelerates. We face many
          difficult tradeoffs as the pace picks up. Assuring a just transition
          means not only helping those dependent on the fossil fuels being
          phased out, but also on causing as few new problems as possible while
          quickening the pace. No small challenge.

          Finally, I visited a World War II cemetery in Imphal and several
          battlefields outside the city. History has long focused on the two
          main theaters of WWII — Europe and the Pacific. But the war was fought
          here, too, as Japan pursued what was known as the Burma campaign, an
          almost insane attempt to fight their way across British-controlled
          Burma and into British-controlled India that nearly worked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between March and July of 1944, the hills around Imphal and the plain
          approaching the city were the scene of some of the most awful fighting
          in the long, brutal war, which is saying something. The battles of
          Imphal and nearby Kohima, a hilltop city now in the neighboring Indian
          state of Nagaland, became an underappreciated turning point in the war
          in Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
          I visited Kohima a few years ago and walked through its WWII cemetery.
          The graveyard sits next to where one of the most grueling battles
          between the Japanese and Western Allies took place, the Battle of the
          Tennis Court. This is where the Japanese advance into India was
          stopped. The total cost for the Allies at Imphal was 12,500 casualties
          with another 4,000 casualties at Kohima. Some 54,000 Japanese troops
          died, 13,300 or so killed in fighting. Most of the rest simply starved
          in the rainy, junglely hills at the fag end of their broken supply
          lines.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Imphal cemetery, like Kohima’s, is the final resting place of
          thousands of young men — or really mostly boys, some of them
          teenagers. They came from the English countryside, Scotland and Wales.
          Nepali Ghurkhas fought and died, as well, and Africans from British
          colonies there. The Indians who died — and through a cruel twist of
          history Indians fought on both sides — came from parts of the British
          empire so far from where they were killed that they must have felt
          themselves to be in an equally distant and foreign land.

        <p>
          Even more sobering was my visit a battlefield with a group of visiting
          British and Americans, guided by Yumnan Rajeshwor Singh, an Imphal
          local who has organized tours like these, built a museum and even
          helps try to recover remains and personal items for familes on all
          sides of the conflict. We peered into still-existing Allied foxholes,
          looked out across the plain toward where Japanese soldiers poured out
          of the hills. We tried to imagine what that must have been like. Even
          stranger is to imagine what the local tribal peoples indigenous to the
          area experienced. They had their own history of violent clashes with
          each other, but this wasn’t their fight and it must have dumbfounded
          them as to why it was raging with such intensity here.

          World War II wasn’t started for energy in 1939 when Hitler invaded
          Poland, though Japan’s bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941 was in part
          motivated by Tokyo’s fear of being denied access to critical
          industrial commodities in Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet energy — where to obtain it, how to effectively deploy it — shaped
          the greatest conflagration the world had ever known, right to the
          blinding conclusion in the skies over Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not possible to imagine 1944’s battles in Burma from the
          vantage point of Pearl Harbor three years earlier. The atomic bombs of
          1945 could not be foreseen more than a year earlier at the close of
          the bloody episode in Burma.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine moves into a sixth month, its
          reverberations are still rippling out across the world in ways that
          are profoundly altering global energy use — where we obtain it, how we
          deploy it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am not predicting another world war here. But I wonder what we are
          not able now to imagine in our future.

        <p>
          The Himalayan foothills rising from India’s eastern plains can seem as
          far removed from the hectic world of global commerce as the Sundarbans
          swamps we visited earlier in our journey, <a href="#">here</a>,{" "}
          <a href="#">here</a>, and <a href="#">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          But Darjeeling is known the world over. The name conjures up the aura
          of fine tea, thanks to a British colonist’s long-ago hunch that
          Chinese tea bushes would take to these steep hillsides.
          Entrepreneurial Indian growers expanded the horizons of Darjeeling tea
          many fold and far further afield.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today Darjeeling teas are sipped not only, reportedly, at Buckingham
          Palace, but also sold in Paris boutiques, coveted by Munich
          connoisseurs and sought out by Tokyo tea mavens. Darjeeling’s two
          early season tea harvests, especially the ‘first flush’ leaves being
          plucked while we were there, sell at some of the highest international
          prices, comparable to museum quality art and fine wines.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, Darjeeling’s ‘gardens’ — the quaintly colonial local term for
          tea estates that sprawl up, down and across thousands of acres of
          steep slopes — are under profound environmental stresses, including
          from a changing climate. These threaten an area that, tea aside,
          occupies a teeming ecological niche featuring humungous ferns, rare
          birds and scores of insect varieties. They are playing out against the
          backdrop of a society roiled by labor discontent and identity
          politics.
        </p>

        <p>
          The damage will resonate far from India’s shores, to everywhere
          Darjeeling teas are cherished. Of course, the prospect of elite tea
          drinkers being denied their most-refined and pricey cup is far from
          the worst toll climate change could impose. Still, Darjeeling stands
          as a stark example of how climate change impacts are ricocheting
          around the globe, disrupting lives and local livelihoods, global
          commerce and international exchange, a way of existing we’ve long
          taken for granted.
        </p>

        <p>
          The region is also a powerful example of how local business owners —
          in this case the tea growers — and their international customers and
          partners can work to change an industry long stuck in its ways, while
          building resilience against the increasingly thorny challenges the
          changing climate presents.
        </p>

        <p>
          My spouse and sometimes travel companion Michele and (who you’ll
          recall from this earlier <a href="#">post</a>) and I, arrived in
          Darjeeling in March. The gardens were just beginning their annual
          growing and picking cycle, the all-important first growth, or more
          poetically, ‘first flush.’ One of four pickings that take place before
          October, the first flush is the only one that follows a dormancy
          period, spanning the generally mild winter. Tiny, delicate leaves were
          appearing on tea bushes. The air was cool and the views picturesque —
          though, surprisingly, even to me after years experiencing India’s
          pollution elsewhere, smog from the plains far below obscured peaks
          throughout our stay. This included the near mythical Kanchenjunga,
          third-highest peak in the Himalayas (after Everest on the Nepal-China
          border and Pakistan’s K2). Kanchenjunga keeps a quiet vigil over the
          region, a constant presence to the local communities of Nepali-Indians
          who populate Darjeeling and work its tea fields.
        </p>
        <p>
          Darjeeling’s tea industry these days faces a typically troubling brew
          of human and climate-related problems. The biggest climate concerns
          are two-fold. The first is increasingly sporadic precipitation, long
          dry spells punctuated by violent waterfalls of rain or even barrages
          of thick hail, as opposed to the steady drizzle-to-downpour of the
          usual monsoon. The other is rising temperatures, particularly
          higher-than-average temperatures at night — a phenomenon occurring
          across the Himalayan range, sometimes known as the world’s “third
          pole.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Humans have made these problems worse. Industrial-scale illegal
          logging and deforestation from villagers in need of fuel for cooking
          and materials for construction have removed trees and foliage from
          most hillsides. With little left to hold the soil, landslides are
          common. Looking toward the city of Darjeeling across a valley, I could
          still see the scar of a massive landslide caused by a dumping of a
          month’s worth of rain there in a single day last October. Meanwhile,
          tea cultivation practices, developed by growers with little regard to
          nature itself, once removed all the weed and plant life below tea
          bushes leaving no layer of cool, green plant life to hold temperatures
          down.
        </p>

        />

        <p>
          Instead of exacerbating the problems climate change brings, the tea
          industry is realizing it needs to ameliorate them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Gautam Mohan, general manager of large-scale grower Tea Promoters
          India, is among a younger generation of estate owners determined to do
          just that. He’s overseen the installation of drains through the
          group’s gardens to capture and slow the huge volumes of water that run
          down the slopes during intense rain ‘bombs’. They’ve built bamboo
          frames to hold the soil in place. He’s been deeply involved in his
          estates’ transition to organic farming, an ambitious overhaul of
          almost every aspect of how the plantations operate, from substituting
          natural for manufactured fertilizers and eliminating chemical
          pesticides to nurturing swaths of uncultivated wilderness on their
          lands. The shift to organic methods got started at many plantations at
          the insistence of buyers in Europe, but many growers like Mohan have
          embraced the new methods as one of their best tools to build up the
          resilience of their bushes against new stresses from changing climate.
          For some, the efforts have become a sort of natural version of the
          kaizen — or “continuous improvement” — ethos that pervaded the
          Japanese auto industry I covered in the early 1990s.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Can more be done? Yes. Much more can be done,” says Mohan. “What are
          we doing to uphold our future and take charge of it? That’s where a
          lot of the answers lie. It’s doing it collectively where you get the
          real impact.”
        </p>

        <p>
          I recommend to anyone with a deeper interest in the region’s tea a
          delightful book I drew on extensively for my visit: Darjeeling, The
          Colorful History and Precarious Fate of the World’s Greatest Tea, by
          Jeff Koehler. Koehler tells the whole fascinating history of the
          region along with a thorough look at the industry’s current
          challenges. It includes a cast of characters worthy of the tea the
          region produces.

          Michele and I spent much of our visit on gardens owned by the Chiabari
          and Ambootia groups, both of which have also gone organic. Krishnendu
          Chatterjee, who oversees Ambootia for a European investor group that
          owns Ambootia, says he has converted ten tea estates to organic
          farming in his career. When he arrives to begin an organic makeover —
          a years-long undertaking that involves transforming nearly every
          aspect of how an estate operates — he gathers the entire staff of the
          estate together to collectively create a compost heap. It symbolizes
          the new ethos of natural methods.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Everybody has to contribute a handful of vegetation to lay the
          foundation. Before you change anything else, you have to change human
          minds,” he says. “It’s not only good for the environment. It also
          makes the community better because they have a spirit of doing
          something good for the world.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Kaushik Das, who oversees five gardens for Ambootia (including one
          that dates back to the 1850s, the oldest in Darjeeling), let me tag
          along with him on his daily routine as the tea season swung into high
          gear at the Chongtong estate.
        </p>

        <p>
          We rode together in his four-wheel-drive up and down the slopes, from
          the fields where the tender first leaves were being plucked by hand,
          to the factory where they were carefully processed, to the “cow pack
          pit” where shells from organic eggs are ground up, mixed with cow
          dung, packed in a hollow cow horn, then buried to yield organic
          fertilizer brimming with microbial life.
        </p>

        <p>
          As we tooled our way toward his bungalow at the end of the day, he
          paused to reflect. “We believe that we are standing on the belly of
          mother earth,” he told me. “If we are doing good, there will be no
          upset. Our climate impact will go down.”
        </p>

          The brutal war in Ukraine and its reverberations across Europe are a
          long way from where my recent travels have taken me: the hills of
          Darjeeling, their slopes steeped in tea and nostalgia for the
          long-gone British Empire, and the fertile plain that spreads out
          between the city of Kolkata and the Himalayan foothills.

          Yet my encounters with two trains, one in each place, resonated with
          the thorny energy dilemmas the world faces in responding to Russian
          aggression. Namely, how do economies, systems and societies transition
          from one energy source (say, imported coal and natural gas) to others
          (like domestically available solar, wind and nuclear power) in a
          damned hurry?

          adapting and why adaptation is critical. But in this post, I want to

          The first train encounter took me back in time to India’s coal-fired,
          colonial past on a steam locomotive through the storied hills of
          Darjeeling. The second transported me forward toward modern India’s
          decarbonized future: riding (even a short stint driving!) an electric
          locomotive of the sort that increasingly dominates India’s rail
          network.
        </p>

        <p>And what a rail network it is!</p>

        <p>
          This post also serves to introduce the Indian Railways, one of the
          world’s most remarkable institutions. The railway figures prominently
          in my journey from here on out. It’s how I am making my way around the
          subcontinent, and it occupies an important role in India’s transition
          from coal to clean electricity. It’s an institution that touches
          almost every part of India and virtually every Indian in some way.
        </p>

        <p>
          Among the oldest railroads in the world — and the first in Asia —
          Indian Railways transports more people, more places than any railway
          outside of China. Daily, that’s 23 million riders, along with 3
          million tons of freight. It’s like moving all of Australia every 24
          hours. Wholly owned by the government, Indian Railways operates 40,300
          miles of tracks, enough to go around the earth and then some. It’s one
          of the world’s largest employers, with 1.5 million workers. Its lines
          reach nearly every corner of the country, piercing jungles, scaling
          mountains, tracing coastlines, sprawling across dense cities and
          traversing fertile rural plains. Passengers are from all walks,
          migrant laborers traveling to and returning home from far away jobs,
          bureaucrats making their daily commute, farmers toting produce to city
          bazaars, inspectors bound for rural villages, soldiers commissioned to
          far-flung posts, and the pious on the country’s never-ending
          pilgrimage circuit. Railway freight is the lifeblood of the economy:
          grains and lentils, kernels and bulbs, clothes and textiles,
          appliances, cement, chemicals, cars, coal.

        <p>
          Indian Railways is also the largest single energy consumer in India,
          as recently as 2017 guzzling up as much as 2.6 billion liters of
          diesel fuel and 18 trillion watts of power a year. That’s more than 3%
          of the country’s entire consumption of diesel and about 2% of its
          electricity. Were Indian railways a country, that sort of energy
          consumption would rank it among the top 100 consuming nations.
        </p>

        <p>
          The history of the railway is the story of India becoming a modern
          nation. And to the extent the railway is a microcosm of India, it can
          help explain three things:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The inevitability of energy transition now that the incentives are
            in place.
          </li>
          <li>
            Why transitions like these usually take so long and are so
            devilishly complicated.
          </li>
          <li>How the transition can be accelerated.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So, all aboard!</p>

        <p>
          With so much romance shrouding memories of the steam locomotive, it’s
          easy to forget why the first ones in India were dubbed “Fire
          Chariots.” There’s a small inferno in its belly, driving it. Though
          engineering feats for their time, these are seriously noisy,
          smoke-belching, sooty, coal-dust-smeared machines.
        </p>

        <p>
          That becomes obvious when you board a rail carriage behind one, as my
          wife, Michele, and I did in Darjeeling. We took what’s billed as the
          tourist “joy ride” from the former colonial hill town up to the city
          of Ghum, which hosts the highest train station in the world at 2,258
          meters (7,407 feet). The line runs on a track gauge so narrow that the
          locomotive is commonly referred to as the “Toy Train.” The locomotive
          and two cars cut a vertiginous path along ridges and through hillside
          towns and villages. Once the workhorses of India’s rail system, only a
          handful of steam locomotives operate today, all of them tourist
          attractions like the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway we rode. The line,
          launched in 1881, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eager riders packed into the two carriages pulled by our locomotive.
          The experience was certainly redolent of India’s colonial history,
          with the difference that it’s now fully owned, operated and, in these
          days of Covid, ridden almost entirely by Indians. But we could also
          understand the disappointment expressed by many a Trip Advisor
          reviewer that the line segment currently operating offers few majestic
          views — due to overbuilding along the tracks — and almost constant,
          ear-piercing whistle shrieks aimed at pedestrian and auto traffic on
          the road the train runs along.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an experience mainly for rail aficionados and connoisseurs of
          colonialism — as well, perhaps, as the occasional reporter looking for
          historical perspective on energy transition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coal-fired steam locomotives have become novelties for a reason:
          cleaner, cheaper, better technologies followed, replacing them. India
          imported its first diesel locomotive from the U.S. in 1957, ten years
          after it won its independence. And for decades diesel dominated
          India’s railways. Yet coal-fired steam hardly disappeared overnight.
          The last steam locomotive — dubbed the Antim Sitara, or “The Last
          Star” — was made in 1970. India retired its last working steam
          locomotive in 1995.

          Nearly all the while, another contender was slowly rising: electric
          locomotives. The first in India rolled out of what was known as
          Victoria Terminus Station in Bombay in 1925. The first electric
          locomotive built in India was commisioned in 1961, only four years
          after the import of that first diesel locomotive.
        </p>
        <p>
          But only quite recently has Indian Railways begun deploying electric
          locomotives at a record clip — because now they’re the cornerstone of
          the government’s plan to go green. By the end of this year, electric
          locomotives should be running on virtually all Indian Railways’ main
          lines. This is why I stopped outside Kolkata to visit the Chittaranjan
          Locomotive Works, India’s most storied locomotive plant.
        </p>
        <p>
          CLW, as the factory and testing ground are known, built India’s first
          domestic steam locomotives. Before that, the Indian colonial
          administration, known as the Raj, imported all of them from mother
          ship Britain. CLW also made that first electric locomotive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chittaranjan is basically a company town — along the lines of Toyota
          City in Japan, the hometown of Toyota Motors, which I visited when I
          covered the Japanese auto industry in the 1990s. Except that while
          Toyota City is a bit of an industrialized car town, Chittaranjan
          remains an oddly bucolic enclave where close to 50,000 workers and
          their families live, attend school, and take part in all manner of
          community activities, from cricket to traditional Hindi language
          poetry.
        </p>
        <p>
          The community was purpose-built, ordered up by India’s first prime
          minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, having helped throw off its colonial
          masters the previous year. Nehru visited several times, one of a
          parade of international notables who came for a look, including
          Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev,
          Chinese premier Chou En-Lai, Egyptian and Yugoslavian strongmen Gamal
          Abdul Nasser and Marshall Tito, even the Dalai Lama.

          CLW just finished producing a record 486 locomotives in the past year,
          all of them electric. The company believes this could be more
          locomotives manufactured in a single plant in a year than ever in
          history — and plans to apply to the Guinness World Records to prove
          it. The company’s general manager, S.K. Kashyup, told me the factory
          plans make 540 more this year, about half of all the locomotives that
          will be made in India. The railway ministry, indeed the entire
          government, has made electrification of the railway a pillar of
          efforts to meet their goal to decarbonize the economy by 2070. So far,
          the railway has electrified about 85% of the most heavily used lines
          in the network. During my tour of the CLW’s cavernous workshop, I even
          drove one of these 125-ton electric locomotives (with a lifelong CLW
          test engineer at my side!). They are quiet, clean and remarkably easy
          to drive (at least for the roughly one-tenth of a mile I was at the
          helm!). By the end of next year nearly all major lines will be
          electrified.
        </p>
        <p>So is mission go-green accomplished then?</p>
        <p>
          This is where the devilish complexity starts. Electrifying the
          locomotives is only step one. To get India off coal, now come the hard
          parts. Since two-thirds of India’s overall electrical generation comes
          from coal, electrifying locomotives just swaps one fossil fuel,
          diesel, for another, the coal that creates the electricity. Phasing
          out coal from India’s energy mix is a much more difficult challenge,
          given the scale of total electricity demand and the tens of millions
          of Indian livelihoods that depend on the coal industry itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if trains run on electricity, at at least that’s no longer Indian
          Railways’ problem, right? Unfortunately, the demise of coal will
          create another, almost bigger problem for Indian railways. Since its
          earliest days, coal has been the biggest and most profitable freight
          that the Indian railway carts around. Indeed, the railway overcharges
          for coal freight, so that it can undercharge for basic passenger
          fares. Indians tend to see this as both fair to legions of poor and
          lower-middle class riders and critical for an economy that
          incorporates a lots of domestic migrant labor requiring cheap travel.
        </p>
        <p>
          As renewable energy pushes coal out of the power generation system,
          the corresponding drop in coal freight will eventually lead to big
          problems with railway finances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay, you say, then just stop the cross-subsidization and make
          passenger fares reflect the cost of passenger travel? Well, that is
          easier said than done. This is because the railway is government
          owned, an essential public service and… India is a democracy. Every
          one of the 23 million daily riders — who don’t want to pay higher
          ticket fares — is a voter. As are all 1.5 million employees, many of
          whom belong to unions close to political parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can see how all this gets very complicated for the politicians,
          who have a lot of influence over the railway. We’ll dig into some of
          that complexity — which runs through India’s entire energy economy —
          in future posts.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, suffice it to say this complexity is why energy transitions
          take so long, left to their own devices. Yet this energy transition
          must happen fast. It cannot be left to its own devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          What new devices then? That’s where we come back to the critical,
          cross-border cooperation needed between the developed world — which
          has the capital needed to smooth out rocky adjustments such as these —
          and a developing world with entirely reasonable and growing energy
          demand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deals need to be made for the good of all. A radical step-up in
          investment from developed countries into the developing world is
          urgent and long overdue, not only in renewable energy but also to help
          phase out coal power generation in a hurry. Indian leaders are quietly
          realizing how much they’ll ultimately waste by pushing on with coal,
          but neither do they have the sums needed, up front, to retire coal
          generating plants early and keep up with power demand. Wealthy
          countries are, maybe, starting to grasp just how much it will cost
          later to address climate impacts from continued use of coal.
          Ultimately cheaper, definitely wiser, and simply the right thing to
          do, wealthy countries should fund now what developing countries
          cannot.
        </p>
        <p>
          The benefit would be a gain for all. Otherwise, the toll on everyone
          will be far larger later.

          Nearly every tea plantation in India has adopted at least some organic
          farming methods to build resilience of their crops, in part against
          the growing ravages of climate change. At Nuxalbari Tea Estate in the
          Dooars region of West Bengal, Sonia Jabbar views organic farming
          methods as just one part of a wider effort to reintroduce elements of
          nature, wilderness, to the estate. That means everything from reviving
          microbial life in the soil to welcoming some considerably larger
          visitors (see above tweet). Sonia, as you’ll hear, is something of a
          force of nature herself, the only woman who both owns and runs —
          hands-on, day-to-day — a tea estate in India.

        <p>
          Here’s one of the bigger ironies of my journey through India reporting
          on climate change and energy transition:
        </p>
        <p>
          I traveled more than 5,000 miles by rail, virtually all of it on
          trains pulled by electrified locomotives; yet where ever I went I saw
          coal piled high on railway cars pulled by those same electric
          locomotives. The paradox captures the tricky turning point India and
          the world have reached in the transition from fossil fuels to
          renewable energy, primarily solar and wind.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Indian Railways, India’s largest energy consumer, has transitioned
          its fleet of locomotives to electricity not to save the world nor to
          “go green” for purposes of publicity (though the railway and Indian
          government love to boast about it). This transition, long ago from
          coal to diesel and more recently from diesel to electric, happened
          because it saves the railway billions annually on the cost of diesel
          fuel, nearly all of which India must import.

          My visit to the Chittaranjan Locomotive Works, after a ride on one of
          the last coal-fired trains on the planet, underscored how far the
          railway has come — and how far it has to go.

          Despite going electric, has the railway really weaned itself off
          fossil fuels? Well, no. Since more than two-thirds of India’s
          electricity is generated from coal, that’s more or less the proportion
          of the electricity the railway is drawing on for its new power source.
          Now, since electrical propulsion is considerably more efficient than
          diesel power, progress is being made.
        </p>
        <p>
          But India’s larger dependence on coal is amply underscored by the long
          chains of coal transport rakes I passed in my travels.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a spring heat wave and India’s economic bounceback from Covid
          lockdowns strained the country’s power grid, the railway has scrambled
          to race coal supplies to thermal power generation plants across the
          nation to limit power cuts. This is good business for the railway.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coal remains the railway’s single largest and most profitable freight
          class — another way the Indian Railways remains, like the rest of the
          country, highly dependent on coal.

          The Russian invasion of Ukraine this year has cost India tens of
          billions of dollars as turmoil in the oil market has pushed up prices
          — even for countries, like India, willing to purchase discounted
          Russian oil
        </p>
        <p>
          That has India — like Europe, albeit to a lesser and more
          self-tortured extent — looking favorably on coal. Where Europe is
          extending the operations of some coal generators it had planned to
          phase out, India is newly considering expansions to its coal fleet.
          Both moves are a nod to the growing concerns countries everywhere have
          about energy security amid the energy transition and a more turbulent
          geopolitical environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those worries can’t be dismissed, with parts of Europe at war and
          tensions rising in Asia over Taiwan. They will persist as long as the
          world remains deeply dependent on fossil fuels, whether it’s Russian
          gas piped to Europe or Saudi Arabian oil shipped through the South
          China Sea.

          Still, the flip side of the Indian rail coal paradox shouldn’t be
          forgotten. Indian Railways transitioned from coal to diesel to
          electric because it made financial sense. With the cost of renewable
          energy in India now well below that of coal — and practicalities such
          as how to store some of that energy for use when the sun isn’t shining
          and the wind isn’t blowing being worked out — many of Indian Railway’s
          coal customers will eventually figure out how to phase out coal as
          well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The government is already pushing renewable energy hard, upping
          incentives for solar and wind power and rolling out an ambitious plan
          to become a global player in green hydrogen production. Green hydrogen
          is derived from solar and wind power and can then burned cleanly or
          stored.
        </p>
        <p>
          Renewable energy is growing rapidly in India, faster than every other
          major country in the past year. It will grow even faster from here on.
          The country is aiming for half its electricity to be produced by
          non-fossil resources by 2030. Because the country’s electricity
          consumption is also growing fast — on the order of 6% a year — coal
          won’t likely go into decline by then.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as with the railway, the gears will be well in motion to send coal
          into terminal decline not long after that, perhaps at a pace far
          faster than many now foresee.
