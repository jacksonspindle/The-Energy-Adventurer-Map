          The Sundarbans — the “beautiful forest” — sprawl into a delta where
          three legendary rivers of South Asia meet the Bay of Bengal. It is the
          largest and most complex mangrove ecosystem in the world, a tidal
          estuary half again larger than Florida’s Everglades.
        </p>

        <p>But the Sundarbans are in deep trouble.</p>

        <p>
          Dr. Krishna Ray and a determined team of young botanists she oversees
          are trying to rescue them. That’s not easy when surprisingly little is
          understood about precisely how these complicated swamps grow and
          thrive. Dr. Ray and her team are discovering what makes them tick.
          Hemendra Kotal, Chayan Giri and Anup Mandal are part of the team. All
          three grew up in West Bengal, the Indian state where the Sundarbans
          are located.
        </p>

        <p>
          Still, they come from distinctly different backgrounds. Anup grew up
          in a town where the Himalayan hills in the state’s north begin to give
          way to the alluvial plain that defines its south. Hemendra is from the
          mega-city of Kolkata, once British India’s colonial capital, upstream
          from the Sundarbans. Chayan was born and raised in the Sunderbans
          themselves, on the largest island among more than 100, facing the Bay
          of Bengal. They are in their mid-twenties, pursuing doctoral studies.
          Two other members of the team — Ranjan Pradhan and Subhra Kanti
          Tripathy — are locals from the village of Ramganga who help with the
          work.
        </p>

        <p>
          I tagged along with the group as they traveled the winding waterways
          by boat gathering samples of soil, water and the many varieties of
          mangrove plants. They pored over everything from the precise
          composition of plant species in each patch of mangrove they are
          restoring — Ceriops decandra versus Aegialitis rotundifolia,
          Xylocarpus mekongensis compared to Bruguiera gymnorrhiza — to the
          array of microbial bacteria inhabiting the soil deep below the
          surface. Dr. Ray toggled effortlessly on deck between encouraging her
          team of Ph.D. candidates and cajoling her project funders in the
          Indian government by mobile phone.

        <p>
          As distant as this meandering amalgam of islands and waterways can
          seem — even for many Indians and neighboring Bangladeshis, whose
          country takes in more than half of the delta — the region matters
          globally. Mangroves are impressive carbon storehouses, locking up
          millions of tons of the stuff both above and below ground. Like
          tropical rainforests, they are super-dense, intricate agglomerations
          of plants and animals — from legions of bacteria and armies of insects
          to the last 250 or so wild Royal Bengal tigers — so big their
          destruction would be felt far beyond their actual borders.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mangrove roots plunge deep into the waterlogged soil — a mix of clay,
          sand, and silt — holding it in place against powerful tidal ebbs and
          flows twice each day. Those same roots also rise back up from the soil
          surface in knobby protrusions the plants literally breathe through.
          Robust mangrove stands can buffer the increasingly intense cyclones
          that batter these shores beginning late spring and running through to
          the fall. They are also critical to managing the inexorable rise of
          the sea level itself, one of several climate change impacts wreaking
          havoc across the fragile ecosystem.
        </p>

        <p>
          Healthy mangroves function as a protective barrier for life above the
          waterline. This includes the more than four million Indians and three
          million Bangladeshis who inhabit this tenuous landscape. The area was
          very sparsely populated before the British colonial government began
          encouraging migration here in hopes of expanding its tax base and
          obtaining new forest resources to export.
        </p>

        <p>
          Population growth has exploded in the past half-century. Yet apart
          from some tourism, fishing, logging, and honey gathering, there’s
          virtually no large-scale economic activity. Everyone here suffers
          burdens of accelerating climate change, but they are falling most
          heavily on women, who are responsible for finding potable water and
          much of the work in rice paddies and fields, both increasingly
          difficult tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Distant as all this may seem, their struggles with climate change will
          become increasingly familiar to people everywhere. Their world is
          changing fast now, much faster than they have the resources or
          wherewithal to adapt to. They’re losing ground, in small but steady
          increments tide after tide, in larger chunks cyclone by cyclone. Four
          large storms have slammed into the area in the past three years,
          leaving scars across the interwoven land and seascape and its
          inhabitants reeling, humans and microbes alike.

        <p>
          This is the first of three dispatches on my visit to the Sundarbans.
        </p>

        <p>
          Regular readers will notice they are the first I’m focusing squarely
          on climate change impact, rather than energy transition. That’s been a
          deficiency of this space, since they’re really two sides of the same
          coin. The solutions to global warming — energy transition,
          restructuring our agricultural system, rethinking how we build things
          and live our lives — will only be possible if we also manage our way
          through the tumult caused by climate change itself in ways that
          maintain a modicum of stability. This will require resilience. So it’s
          worth a look at some communities, however removed from our own
          experience, fully in the throes of trying to develop this sort of
          resilience.
        </p>

        <p>
          They are harbingers of the profound challenges careening toward the
          rest of the world as global warming gains momentum. The longer we wait
          to eliminate the greenhouse gas emissions causing the climate to warm,
          the more our future will resemble their struggle to keep up with a
          rapidly changing world.
        </p>

        <p>
          The residents of the Sundarbans did nothing to cause climate change.
          Most didn’t even have electricity until a decade or so ago. Some still
          don’t. A minuscule few own cars. Yet if climate change is threatening
          to overwhelm the Sundarbans, humans are nonetheless doing plenty to
          help it. They dam and divert the rivers that spill down from the
          Himalayas and across the plains, diminishing the flow of fresh water
          from the north into the swampy delta. Meanwhile, they build ever
          higher berms and embankments on the Bay of Bengal to the south to try
          to keep the sea off the land, especially during storms. The
          embankments displace mangroves, often through misguidedly uprooting
          them during construction.
        </p>

        <p>
          The combination is a deadly challenge to complex mangrove ecosystems,
          which are what they are in part due to wide gradations in water and
          soil salinity. It’s the worst of both worlds for them, with humans
          literally uprooting them from one side and denying them the brackish
          water by blocking the fresh water flow from the rivers on the other.
        </p>

        <p>
          The result is a vicious cycle: degrading mangroves leave islands more
          exposed to rising sea levels and more frequent and forceful storms;
          that spurs the construction of more embankments, which makes it harder
          for mangroves to regain a foothold. The West Bengal state government
          now requires 50 meters of shoreline in front of embankments, but in
          practice, the barriers usually wind up being built right at the
          water’s edge or the land in front of them erodes away. The result is
          mile upon mile of embankments lining river banks denuded of mangrove.
        </p>

          alt=" by Bill Spindle"
        />

        <p>
          This is the cycle Dr. Ray and her teams are seeking to break — by
          figuring out how to help the mangroves grow back.
        </p>

        <p>
          It turns out to be harder than just re-planting. They’re puzzling out
          why, finding ways to turn barren stretches of river bank back into
          robust mangrove habitat. My trip with them was one of dozens they make
          each year.
        </p>

        <p>
          A key, they have found, is grasses. Grasses are found only sparsely in
          fully developed mangrove stands. But Dr. Ray and her team have
          discovered they play a critical role in helping mangroves gain new
          footholds where they have lost their grip on the shifting mud flats.
          Once grasses are established, the mangrove seedlings nestle into the
          grassy tangle. There they can grow, protected from being washed away
          in the intense, twice-daily tidal currents.
        </p>

        <p>
          So Dr. Ray and her team start not with the mangroves, but rather more
          humbly — with the grasses. Where it works, this breaks the vicious
          cycle. Grasses give way to the growth of various mangroves that like
          the salty seawater at the shoreline. As silt and sand build around
          those, nurturing them further, the salinity levels in the soil drop,
          and other less-salt water-loving mangrove species take hold.
          Eventually, the collective habitat begins to resemble the robust
          stands that existed before and still survive in less populated, more
          protected parts of the Sundarbans.
        </p>
        <p>
          In total, the 31 plots her team is restoring add up to less than a
          quarter of a mile square, scattered about the inhabited parts of a
          wetland that covers 3,800 square miles. She hopes to expand to many
          more sites as they refine their work
        </p>
        <p>
          This will take years, if not decades, and lots of replanting and
          nurturing by Dr. Ray’s team and local villagers they enlist in the
          effort. Some parts may never grow back the same. Ray and her team have
          been trying to reestablish a species of mangrove known as Sundari — a
          variety once so dominant that some believe it’s where the name of the
          region comes from. Sundari have very little salt tolerance, so
          struggle to grow in the saltier soils that now dominate the
          Sundarbans.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We planted more than six thousand seedlings, but we failed,” says Dr.
          Ray, undeterred. “Now with the monsoon rains the salinity of the soil
          has dropped and we’ll try again.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Where they have had success, the end result is a village protected by
          an embankment that is shielded by a buffer of mangroves. The
          combination, where it exists, has stood up against even the strongest
          storms so far. From there the mangroves can grow and spread, as they
          have here for thousands of years.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Where we plant and what we plant is important. We have to study them
          first,” says Anup. “A forest can only be defined by multiple species.”
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of our four-day journey through the Sundarbans, Dr. Ray and
          her team puzzled over something they noticed: a particular bacteria
          exists in far lower concentrations in pristine areas of the wetland
          where they have taken samples, compared to the areas they have under
          restoration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, the more developed the restoration, the lower the
          concentration is of this particular microbe in the soil.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We’re looking closely at this,” Dr. Ray asks her team. “Why is this?”

        <p>
          War in Ukraine rages. Markets roil. Inflation has spiked. New waves of
          Covid gain deadly momentum, especially in China, the country with the
          world’s largest population and second largest economy. Worries abound.
        </p>

        <p>
          Still, the need to address global warming remains more urgent than
          ever, even if tempting to place on a backburner. We still need to push
          forward with climate solutions, multitasking our way through a
          plethora of emergencies competing for our attention, many caused in
          part or worsened by climate change itself. One only need to read the
          news, albeit now on the inside pages, sidebar scrolls and
          off-prime-time broadcasts, to be reminded of this urgency.
        </p>

        <p>
          So I’m forging ahead here with the second of three posts on my visit
          to the Indian Sundarbans (the first). Here the war in Ukraine seems
          distant, while the ravages of global warming present immediate
          challenges each day. Bricks and sandbags accumulate in every village
          this time of year, as the annual reinforcement of homes and river
          embankments against cyclones takes place. It’s one of the many
          practices that once provided a measure of protection against rising
          waters but are now increasingly found wanting in the face of the more
          frequent and powerful storms global warming generates.
        </p>

        <p>
          So far in this newsletter, we’ve visited a tiny, cattle-fueled biogas
          facility serving a school (this earlier post) and a mangrove
          restoration initiative by a curious botanist (my last post, as also
          linked above). Here we look at a community resilience-building
          initiative started by a village-born kid turned international IT
          consultant who is now helping back home.
        </p>

        <p>
          These small efforts may seem insignificant in the face of war in
          Europe, much less the sheer scale of the climate challenge. Each
          alone, they are. But small-scale, local initiatives such as these, in
          aggregate and across the world are just as essential to adapting to
          global warming and pushing towards solutions as the mega-projects I’ll
          look at later in the journey.
        </p>

        <p>
          In a way, the mega-scale undertakings needed to arrest climate change
          — transitioning away from fossil fuels and overhauling agriculture to
          eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, to name the most urgent — will
          happen only on foundations laid by local climate adaptation efforts.
          They’re what will help communities maintain the wherewithal to take on
          the big changes ahead.
        </p>

        <p>
          Few understand change better than inhabitants of the Sundarbans.
          Theirs is a world of shifting land, tidal surges and furious cyclones.
          They know how to adapt. Yet today they find it ever harder to keep up
          with the pace of climate change.

        <p>
          Sankar Halder grew up here, in the tiny village of Purba Shridharpur.
          As a kid, his smarts caught the attention of a teacher who helped him
          get into a better school in the city of Kolkata a few hours train ride
          away. His village pulled together to help his family pay. He
          eventually joined the budding field of information technology, landed
          a job at one of India’s top IT consultancies and worked for a decade
          and a half in the U.S. and Australia. Then he returned to India.
        </p>
        <p>
          Halder, 48, lives in Kolkata now with his wife and two teenage
          daughters. But he spends a lot of time back in Purba Shridharpur.
          There he runs Mukti, a private nonprofit organization aiming to build
          a kind of community resilience he hopes can stand up to the ravages of
          climate change even in the Sundarbans, one of the most vulnerable
          places on the planet. Gradually he’s expanding the approach across the
          state of West Bengal and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
          Born under a thatch roof, educated in a big city, internationalized
          while working abroad, Halder still says of Purba Shridharpur, “This is
          my home.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He’s one of millions of local leaders around the world trying to help
          their communities become more resilient to the impacts of a rapidly
          changing climate. Tens if not hundreds of millions more will be
          necessary. They’re needed not just to help communities adapt to the
          fallout of global warming. The resilience they foster also bolsters
          community capacity to take on the often equally disruptive changes
          required to decarbonize our way of life, whether that’s overhauling
          agriculture or how we produce and consume energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Communities put off those changes if they’re forever trying recover
          from one crisis and bracing for the next — which is increasingly what
          life in the Sunderbans looks like. This vicious cycle will
          characterize life in many more places as the impacts of global warming
          gain momentum, which they inexorably will until worldwide emissions of
          greenhouse gases net out at zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mukti, which means “freedom” in Bengali, does many things: provides
          jobs, makes small loans to entrepreneurial women, promotes sustainable
          agriculture, and works on health care and sanitation. Its housing
          initiative epitomizes Halder’s approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine a house built not only to stand up, but even more expressly to
          stay down — anchored to the ground against the strongest winds and
          rushing floodwaters cyclones can muster. It’s a home, but also a place
          where a family could shelter during a cyclone. After withstanding a
          storm, it’s back to being a home again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Actually, you don’t have to imagine. Here’s what it looks like, one of
          three prototype houses Mukti is constructing for 100 families in the
          pilot phase of the initiative…
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          The homes are a model for more than just housing. They embody a
          community-based, government-backed, privately-run ethos, paid for
          mostly with a blend of government and Mukti funds (which largely come
          from corporate social responsibility funds and charitable
          contributions). Buyers put up about 20% of the roughly $3,500 cost of
          a house in cash, and sometimes their own labor.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We say, ‘We’ll build you a durable, flood-tolerant home. Why don’t
          you spend some time helping build the community?’” says Halder. “We
          don’t give anything for free. You have to work for it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The homestead initiative even has an element of international
          cooperation. The houses are designed by Laurent Fournier, a French
          architect based in Kolkata who has developed a specialization in
          affordable, cyclone-resistant, flood-tolerant housing.
        </p>

        <p>
          The homes use traditional local materials such as jute plant, bamboo
          and thatch, combined with some concrete, tin and even chicken wire for
          added strength. The roof support system is based on the same
          principles as a Japanese parasol, which stands out in this photo of
          the upper floor.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          Yet if the housing embodies Halder’s vision, education is the key to
          realizing it, he says. That’s why one of Mukti’s biggest initiatives
          provides supplementary schooling for more than 6,000 elementary,
          middle, and high school students at 52 locations. Kids chosen for
          Mukti’s supplemental classes arrive at school at 6 am, three hours
          before the start of the regular school day, which they then attend as
          well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Supplemental schooling is critical for children who often attend
          failing public schools with hundreds of students per teacher. But it
          is one of the first things to go when poor families lose their income,
          simply because they don’t have other non-essential expenses to cut.
          This leaves these communities even more vulnerable over the long haul,
          unable to escape from round after round of repeated disaster. With
          education, villagers will better grasp the challenges, develop better
          capability to address them, and learn the skills necessary to thrive
          elsewhere if they’re overwhelmed in the end and have to move.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Whatever the situation becomes, we have to keep our education up and
          running. Without that we cannot break this cycle.” says Halder
        </p>
        <p>And climate change?</p>
        <p>
          “Climate and environment cut across it all. Agriculture has to be
          climate resilient. Your health needs to be. Your livelihood. Your
          housing,” he told me as we sipped tea on a cool morning in his garden,
          down the dirt road from Mukti’s main headquarters near the village.
          “Whatever the economic or development initiative, it has to be climate
          resilient, especially in this region, or it doesn’t make any sense. We
          can do many things, but overnight a cyclone can come along and destroy
          everything.”

        <p>
          I had zig-zagged through the Sundarbans for five days, from the
          populated western side to the wildlife reserve in the east and then
          half way back, before I finally reached a pair of islands located
          where the Ganges River meets the Bay of Bengal.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here I met Sourav Giri, who had agreed to be my guide to the islands
          of Ghoramara and Gangasagar. We greeted each other after my car pulled
          into what’s known by its map coordinates as Lot 8. This is where the
          ferries depart from.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had explained to Sourav that my mission was to report on the impacts
          of climate change. Within minutes of setting off toward the first of
          these islands, the bright, energetic 32-year-old — a guy who taught
          himself to speak English by conversing alone in front of a mirror —
          was exclaiming to me, “Who will save us?”
        </p>

        <p>
          He was exclaiming, rather than asking, because when it comes to the
          dwindling population of Ghoramara, it is too late for saving.
        </p>

        <p>
          Getting this far in my Sundarbans journey had already been an
          adventure. Five days earlier I had bumped along potholed and buckling
          roads from the nearest big city, Kolkata (once known as Calcutta).
          Three days aboard a boat with a team of researchers transported me
          across the Sundarbans. Another five-hour jostling car ride and I was
          in the village of Purba Shridharpur, where I saw how everything from
          housing to education helps build climate resilience.
        </p>

        <img

        <p>
          Along the way were stretches of pristine mangroves as far as one could
          see, as well as many miles of eroded shoreline lacking almost any
          vegetation. On one morning, a crocodile longer than I am tall lumbered
          off a landing as our boat pulled up so we could, very carefully,
          disembark at the river bank. At another landing a billboard welcomed
          us with a warning about a rogues gallery of snakes, from king cobras
          to constrictors.

        <p>
          Just a few days before I arrived in a town called Raidighi, wildlife
          authorities trapped a Bengal tiger. The tiger was returned to the
          reserve — a development villagers were still relating with relief when
          I showed up. Another day we came across this guy below, hand-catching
          mudskippers deep in the oozy, denuded river bank. They look like a
          cross between a fish and a salamander.
        </p>

        <p>
          And on yet another day, wandering with my botanist guides through
          undisturbed forest, I looked up in wonder to see more bees than I’d
          ever been around in my life. Their buzzing filled the air as they
          weaved in and out of a tangle of flowers in a Nim tree (a.k.a. Indian
          Lilac or, scientifically, Azadirachta indica, as my botanist guides
          informed me). This is the rich density of life the Sundarbans is known
          for.
        </p>

        />

        <p>
          But I also saw plenty of devastation, particularly from May 2020’s
          Cyclone Amphan — which served up terrific, record-setting wind gusts —
          and May 2021’s Cyclone Yaas, which delivered an unprecedented storm
          surge when it arrived during an unusually high tide. Collapsed homes,
          washed-out shoreline embankments, rice paddy fields wasting from
          saltwater inundation — the damage to villages was obvious. Fallen
          trees littered even the thickest and healthiest mangrove stands.
        </p>

        <p>Yet none of this prepared me for Ghoramara and Gangasagar.</p>

        <p>
          If the Sundarbans are among the increasing number of places on earth
          facing an existential threat from climate change, Ghoramara Island has
          reached a point of no return. Nearby Gangasagar doesn’t seem too far
          behind. These are alarming, happening-right-now reminders that the
          cascading challenges of global warming can overwhelm — at first
          slowly, then all at once as they say — even communities well
          accustomed to these sorts of hazards.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s not as if Anil Ghorai, 50, had never been through a cyclone. Born
          on Ghoramara, he was one of dozens of residents we spoke with during
          our visit. The island has lost more than half its area to erosion and
          flooding and three-quarters of its population to migration in the past
          decade or so. One of a few thousand remaining island residents, Ghorai
          saw his home destroyed by winds during Amphan. He had just finished
          rebuilding last year when Cyclone Yaas brought catastrophic flooding.
        </p>

        <p>“Nature didn’t give me time to recover,” he told us.</p>

        <p>
          He extended his arm in a sort of hook-shape, describing how he
          clutched a tree during Yaas, holding tight with his other hand to a
          tin box with his all his savings and irreplaceable documents. Water
          poured over the embankments and swept his newly rebuilt house away.
          His wife, a baby son in her arms, scrambled to the top of a pile of
          bricks left over from the construction to stay above the rising water.
        </p>

        <p>
          “I could never have imagined the entire island going under,” he said,
          standing next to his once-again destroyed home.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yet it did, miraculously leaving not a villager dead during the storm
          itself. Most sheltered on the upper floor of the local school. Here’s
          Sourav showing how high the floodwaters crested at the center of the
          island, just inches below the floor where residents were sheltering...
        </p>

        <img
          src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84a46cd7-7568-4963-804e-17e2b4e55352_4032x3024.jpeg"

        />

        <p>
          Property, homes, material livelihoods — all wiped out, along with
          virtually every living thing on the island that couldn’t swim or fly
          to safety. “Cows, hens, goats, all the animals died,” one resident
          told us.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, too, did the possibility of growing rice or cultivating the betel
          leaf that many on the island grew to supplement their income. School
          textbooks and student records were ruined. For two days, there was no
          drinking water beyond what residents had in the shelter. Emergency
          food supplies took even longer to arrive.
        </p>

        <p>
          “We lost everything,” said Sheikh Sabir, a 24-year-old we met beside a
          pond where he repeatedly threw a net into the water hoping to come up
          with a few fish to help feed his wife, seven-month-old daughter,
          parents, and uncle. Very few fish survive in the once fresh water —
          what locals call “sweetwater” — that dot the island and are now
          markedly saline. He’d caught nothing so far that day.
        </p>

        <p>
          “What will happen next?” he ponders upon being asked. “If the
          government gives us land, we’ll move away.”
        </p>

        <img

          alt=" by Bill Spindle"
        />

        <p>
          Large swathes of the island are now wastelands of infertile soil or
          shoreline that routinely breaks off and dissolves into the water
          flowing past relentlessly. These powerful tidal currents reverse twice
          each day, rushing in and draining out, undermining shoreline
          embankments awaiting the next cyclone.
        </p>

        <p>
          It reminded me of what a program manager at a nonprofit group told me
          earlier in the week. The group, known as the Tagore Society, does a
          wide variety of social and environmental work in the Sundarbans.
        </p>

            “You cannot fight against nature. Nature will fight back. That’s

            has to consider environmental factors because to make a sustainable
            livelihood here is very difficult. Whatever you’ve accomplished in
            two to three years, or even five years or ten years — all of a
            sudden a cyclone comes along and it is finished.”
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Yet moving is no simple task, either.</p>

        <p>
          The government won’t provide land elsewhere. But it is building
          housing on Gangasagar for the most vulnerable residents who can no
          longer scrape out a life on Ghoramara. Thirty families will take up
          the offer this year, adding to a growing community of Ghoramara
          residents who have abandoned the island, according to Sudipta Mondal,
          a local government development official on the bigger island.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mondal is justifiably proud of the government’s record of preventing
          deaths during such big storms. Not long ago, less powerful cyclones
          killed thousands, even tens of thousands. The improvement comes from
          building shelters for even the poorest communities, convincing
          villagers to use them, and using modern meteorology to accurately
          predict where and when cyclones will hit.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yet for the residents of smaller islands like Ghoramara, the only
          long-term alternative remains leaving, Mondal said.
        </p>

        <p>
          “They’re accustomed to having their own land,” he said, “but there’s
          no choice.”
        </p>

        <p>Many, especially the young, move further away than Gangasagar.</p>

        <p>
          We stopped for tea at the shop of Kanai Lal Guchhait. The 64-year-old
          and his wife earn less than 50 cents a day selling tea and biscuits
          now, a fraction of what they made before much of the population,
          especially the working-age men, moved away.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cyclone Ampham wiped out Guchhait’s betel leaf patch. Yaas stopped the
          plants from growing back. His son moved to north India after Amphan.
          After Yaas, his daughter and her husband moved there, as well. Both
          work in food processing factories. A granddaughter remains with
          Guchhait and his wife to attend school.
        </p>
        <p>
          The parents need money from their children to make ends meet. Their
          government-provided monthly food allotment — a little over five pounds
          each of wheat and lentils — lasts only about ten days. Still, they
          resist leaving themselves. Even if a home were offered to them on
          Gangasagar, they would have no space for a tea shop. Guchhait still
          holds out hope his empty dirt plot nearby will once again grow betel
          leaf.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Gangasagar, a far larger island with a population of some 150,000,
          has many challenges of its own. Not least is a huge Hindu festival
          held there each January. Over a span of about two weeks, as many as
          four million pilgrims — yes, you read that right, more than 25 times
          the population of the island — make their way to Gangasager. They
          cross the water on fleets of ferries brought in especially for the
          purpose, operating twenty-four-seven to deliver them to shores
          purpose-dredged for landings at high tide, low tide and everything in
          between.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pilgrims, some annual attendees, others on a once-a-lifetime
          journey of faith, file down to a beach facing the Bay of Bengal to
          purify themselves in the waters. Why they do this here is a fiery tale
          of sin and absolution. Suffice it to say, this is where, in Hindu
          mythology, the gentle and holy waters of the Ganges find the sea after
          gushing from the big toe of Vishnu and then are tamed by falling
          through the matted hair of Shiva — a journey thus involving Hinduism’s
          top two deities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Economically, spiritually, even politically, the festival is too
          important to the island, the state of West Bengal, India’s
          Hindu-nationalist government and the pilgrims themselves to even
          contemplate forgoing or moving the essential dip elsewhere. Yet the
          beach continues to erode away, pounded by some of the fastest-rising
          sea levels in the world. The Kapil Muni Ashram, closely associated
          with the festival, has been moved at least four, and maybe as many as
          seven, times over the past century or so — depending on who you ask —
          to stay ahead of the rising water. It flooded again during Yaas, less
          than a decade after the last move.
        </p>
        <p>
          State and local government and religious foundations have spent
          millions to build infrastructure in the area to handle the crowds. Now
          the local development authority is proposing to spend millions more
          for a barrier made up of thousands of huge concrete “pentapods”
          dropped offshore it hopes of diminishing the wave force and slowing
          the erosion. Neither natural mangrove barriers or the usual man-made
          embankments used to hold back the water can work here, with so many
          pilgrims needing access to the sea in such a short time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here’s a view of Kapil Muni Ashram when I was there. You can see how
          far it is from the beach, which was at my back when I took this photo…

        <p>
          Throughout my three days on the islands, Sourav provided running
          commentary, veering from explanation to interpretation to personal
          observations about everything from geopolitics to linguistics and tea.
          At turns amusing, animated and sad, frequently frustrated but never
          defeated, he had come a long way and was determined to go further. And
          he wanted me to know it.
        </p>
        <p>
          His father, a farmer, ran a tea stall during the festival. Yet Sourav
          himself had gotten an education, a masters degree. For years that
          meant arduous weekly ferry and train journeys to Kolkata and back,
          leaving at 2 am and returning home well into the evening.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I am the first in my family to cultivate my mind instead of
          cultivating crops,” he told me with pride.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had many motivational aphorisms to live by: “To be born poor, that
          is not a sin. To die poor, that is a sin,” he announced as we chugged
          across Ghoramara island in a three-wheeled tuk-tuk. “You have to
          change your own life. Nobody is here to help you,” he offered later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unprompted he began acting out his method for teaching himself
          English: hours of staccato, self-conversation before a mirror, his
          best friend growing up, he said.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “What is your name, sir?” <br></br>“My name is Sourav.”
            <br></br>“Where are you from, sir?”
            <br></br>“I am from Gangasagar.”
            <br></br>“What is your name?”
            <br></br>“What is your age?”
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>“Quite difficult,” he told me.</p>
        <p>
          Now an English tutor to the children of many of Gangasagar’s elite, he
          pulled out his phone to play me instructional Youtube videos he’s
          recorded. In them, he patiently explains the shades of meanings
          between words such as “fresh” (as in fruit) and “raw” (as in meat), or
          when to use “clean,” as opposed to “disinfect” or “sanitize.”
        </p>
        <p>
          As we sat beside an eroded grotty shoreline waiting for the ferry to
          take us off Ghoramara Island, he rattled off the names of India Nobel
          prize laureates, and launched into recitations of English poems he’d
          memorized, including by his favorite poet, William Wordsworth. The
          lines seemed wildly incongruous as we sat on the garbage-strewn shore.
          And yet somehow right on the mark.
        </p>
        <p>He closed his eyes to try to better call up the words…</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Behold her, single in the field,
            <br></br>Yon solitary Highland Lass!
            <br></br>Reaping and singing by herself;
            <br></br>Stop here or gently pass!
            <br></br>Alone she cuts and binds the grain,
            <br></br>And sings a melancholy strain;
            <br></br>O Listen! For the Vale profound
            <br></br>Is overflowing with the sound.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>There he stopped, unable to remember more.</p>

        <p>
          Readers of an energy and climate blog may not need reminding, but I
          beg your indulgence to use this post to do it anyway: the stakes of
          the decisions we’re collectively making on these issues could not be
          higher these days.
        </p>

        <p>
          This hit home for me in triplicate during a stop in India’s
          northeastern state of Manipur. I stayed in the main city, Imphal,
          making excursions into the surrounding countryside. Each made a deep
          impression.
        </p>

        <img

        <p>
          The first outing underscored the ways electricity, even a little bit
          of it, can change the lives of the poor and energy deprived. This is
          the heart of the energy challenge for economically developing
          countries like India, and many even-poorer countries across Asia,
          Africa, and Latin America.
        </p>

        <p>
          I bumped and bounced for five hours in the back seat of a jeep,
          winding deep into the hills beyond Imphal to visit the tiny village of
          Leisang. Leisang happens to be the final village in India to
          officially be electrified, back in 2018. Electricity arrived as part
          of a government drive to grid connect all of India — a country that,
          when I visited for the first time back in 2004, had hundreds of
          millions of people with no electricity at all.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prime Minister Narendra Modi made rural electrification a priority
          when he came to power in 2014. His government gave itself a big pat on
          the back when Leisang connected, hosting a high-profile press
          conference to get the word out.
        </p>

        <img

          alt="Chief Tongsat Haokip where the village connects to the grid.  by Bill Spindle"
        />

        <p>
          The 40 or so villagers of Leisang, a clan from a tribal group known as
          the Kuki, were of course also thrilled. Chief Tongsat Haokip told me
          how he hosted all the adults and many of their children for the big
          event at his home. The switch was flipped, a light went on and the
          villagers cheered and danced for hours. They were surprised by the
          flood of national press that suddenly showed up when the government
          made its announcement, without letting the villagers know in advance.
        </p>

        <p>
          From the moment that bulb lit up, they no longer had to simply dream —
          of their children being able to study after dark, of not having to
          cook by open wood fire inside their home (a terrible health hazard),
          of televisions and of not having to travel a half mile down the
          mountain to charge their mobile phones.
        </p>

        <p>Much of that has come to pass.</p>
        <p>
          “We’re used to the electricity now. Everybody is happy when it’s on,”
          Meena Rai, a 36-year-old mother of five told me as she showed off her
          electric burner.
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0fe838f-85e3-4cf7-85a6-c86e48a969be_4032x3024.jpeg"
          alt="Meena Rai with electric appliances.  by Bill Spindle"
        />
        <p>
          The operative phrase there is, “when it’s on,” of course. As her
          caveat implies, the reality of electrification still hasn’t met the
          hype, to be sure. When I visited, the power had been out for several
          days, a common problem for Leisang and, frankly, just about every
          Indian in a country still unable to deliver consistent power. This
          spring and summer have been especially bad for power outages, amid
          soaring demand, tight supplies, and tangled transportation lines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet even inconsistent access to electricity is changing the lives of
          these villagers, who scrape out an existence growing potatoes and yams
          in the hillsides surrounding their roughly 20 dirt-floored homes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chief Tongsat invested in a television first. Recently, he purchased
          an electric clothes washing machine. This has drastically cut down the
          number of hours his daughters-in-law spend pounding clothes by hand
          out back of the home to clean them. He paid a local car and driver
          service to cart the machine up the steep slope to the village and into
          his home, an interesting example of how the arrival of electricity can
          spur local economic activity even beyond those who directly use it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nearby, Rai now uses an electrical convection burner to cook for her
          five children, although she concedes she sometimes must revert to a
          wood fire when the power fails. She is grateful her kids can complete
          their homework most evenings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lives of Leisang villagers have not been wholly transformed. They
          have been magically empowered. Many of the villagers are still too
          poor to afford much more than a mobile phone. Yet they still felt they
          had been given a ticket to the modern world, even if it was only for
          the cheap seats. This made them hope for more — improved local
          healthcare, a school nearer by, better roads.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those things won’t come any easier than electricity. But every
          villager I talked to felt their lives had improved, and would continue
          to do so. This is what energy can do.

        <p>
          Another day, I visited Loktak Lake, part of a vast freshwater wetland
          that was once an incredibly diverse, globally unique ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          I visited a village here, too, this one much poorer than Leisang. No
          electricity at all here, just a few families that have lived for
          generations literally floating upon the water. Their homes are built
          on wooden rafts. They spend their days fishing and collecting the
          water plants they live off of and sell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their existential problem is for us a reminder that even in solving
          our carbon emissions challenges we can easily create new headaches:
          The delicate wetland has been all but ruined by a hydroelectric dam
          that came online in 1983.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Ithai Hydropower Dam was conceived and constructed with little
          environmental review or consideration for how it would affect the
          villagers and the local ecosystem. It flooded some 83,000 hectares of
          farmland and pasture — an area the size of New York City. Over time,
          this has caused what was essentially a very wide and shallow
          meandering river to stall and silt up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Invasive species have out-competed the native plants and animals in
          this new habitat, choking off the oxygen in the water that supports
          the fish and plant life villagers survive on.

          The poverty in the floating collection of homes — still reachable only
          by boat — was stark, even if the villagers were welcoming and sharing.
          They spoke of their difficulties and challenges getting the local
          government to address their concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          They’ve been fighting for decades to have the dam removed, with
          virtually no success. The state government isn’t listening. Indeed
          it’s planning a large-scale tourism push, including building hotels
          and running boats full of tourists on the lake. It is also planning
          more hydroelectric dams in the area, one way India is adding
          carbon-free energy, while also creating serious environmental
          concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          For me, this was a lesson in how important a considered and careful
          energy transition must be, even as it accelerates. We face many
          difficult tradeoffs as the pace picks up. Assuring a just transition
          means not only helping those dependent on the fossil fuels being
          phased out, but also on causing as few new problems as possible while
          quickening the pace. No small challenge.

          Finally, I visited a World War II cemetery in Imphal and several
          battlefields outside the city. History has long focused on the two
          main theaters of WWII — Europe and the Pacific. But the war was fought
          here, too, as Japan pursued what was known as the Burma campaign, an
          almost insane attempt to fight their way across British-controlled
          Burma and into British-controlled India that nearly worked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between March and July of 1944, the hills around Imphal and the plain
          approaching the city were the scene of some of the most awful fighting
          in the long, brutal war, which is saying something. The battles of
          Imphal and nearby Kohima, a hilltop city now in the neighboring Indian
          state of Nagaland, became an underappreciated turning point in the war
          in Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
          I visited Kohima a few years ago and walked through its WWII cemetery.
          The graveyard sits next to where one of the most grueling battles
          between the Japanese and Western Allies took place, the Battle of the
          Tennis Court. This is where the Japanese advance into India was
          stopped. The total cost for the Allies at Imphal was 12,500 casualties
          with another 4,000 casualties at Kohima. Some 54,000 Japanese troops
          died, 13,300 or so killed in fighting. Most of the rest simply starved
          in the rainy, junglely hills at the fag end of their broken supply
          lines.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Imphal cemetery, like Kohima’s, is the final resting place of
          thousands of young men — or really mostly boys, some of them
          teenagers. They came from the English countryside, Scotland and Wales.
          Nepali Ghurkhas fought and died, as well, and Africans from British
          colonies there. The Indians who died — and through a cruel twist of
          history Indians fought on both sides — came from parts of the British
          empire so far from where they were killed that they must have felt
          themselves to be in an equally distant and foreign land.

        <p>
          Even more sobering was my visit a battlefield with a group of visiting
          British and Americans, guided by Yumnan Rajeshwor Singh, an Imphal
          local who has organized tours like these, built a museum and even
          helps try to recover remains and personal items for familes on all
          sides of the conflict. We peered into still-existing Allied foxholes,
          looked out across the plain toward where Japanese soldiers poured out
          of the hills. We tried to imagine what that must have been like. Even
          stranger is to imagine what the local tribal peoples indigenous to the
          area experienced. They had their own history of violent clashes with
          each other, but this wasn’t their fight and it must have dumbfounded
          them as to why it was raging with such intensity here.

          World War II wasn’t started for energy in 1939 when Hitler invaded
          Poland, though Japan’s bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941 was in part
          motivated by Tokyo’s fear of being denied access to critical
          industrial commodities in Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet energy — where to obtain it, how to effectively deploy it — shaped
          the greatest conflagration the world had ever known, right to the
          blinding conclusion in the skies over Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not possible to imagine 1944’s battles in Burma from the
          vantage point of Pearl Harbor three years earlier. The atomic bombs of
          1945 could not be foreseen more than a year earlier at the close of
          the bloody episode in Burma.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine moves into a sixth month, its
          reverberations are still rippling out across the world in ways that
          are profoundly altering global energy use — where we obtain it, how we
          deploy it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am not predicting another world war here. But I wonder what we are
          not able now to imagine in our future.

        <p>
          The Himalayan foothills rising from India’s eastern plains can seem as
          far removed from the hectic world of global commerce as the Sundarbans
          swamps we visited earlier in our journey,{" "}
          <a href="#https://billspindle.substack.com/">here</a>,
          <a href="https://billspindle.substack.com/">here</a>, and{" "}
          <a href="https://billspindle.substack.com/">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          But Darjeeling is known the world over. The name conjures up the aura
          of fine tea, thanks to a British colonist’s long-ago hunch that
          Chinese tea bushes would take to these steep hillsides.
          Entrepreneurial Indian growers expanded the horizons of Darjeeling tea
          many fold and far further afield.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today Darjeeling teas are sipped not only, reportedly, at Buckingham
          Palace, but also sold in Paris boutiques, coveted by Munich
          connoisseurs and sought out by Tokyo tea mavens. Darjeeling’s two
          early season tea harvests, especially the ‘first flush’ leaves being
          plucked while we were there, sell at some of the highest international
          prices, comparable to museum quality art and fine wines.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, Darjeeling’s ‘gardens’ — the quaintly colonial local term for
          tea estates that sprawl up, down and across thousands of acres of
          steep slopes — are under profound environmental stresses, including
          from a changing climate. These threaten an area that, tea aside,
          occupies a teeming ecological niche featuring humungous ferns, rare
          birds and scores of insect varieties. They are playing out against the
          backdrop of a society roiled by labor discontent and identity
          politics.
        </p>

        <p>
          The damage will resonate far from India’s shores, to everywhere
          Darjeeling teas are cherished. Of course, the prospect of elite tea
          drinkers being denied their most-refined and pricey cup is far from
          the worst toll climate change could impose. Still, Darjeeling stands
          as a stark example of how climate change impacts are ricocheting
          around the globe, disrupting lives and local livelihoods, global
          commerce and international exchange, a way of existing we’ve long
          taken for granted.
        </p>

        <p>
          The region is also a powerful example of how local business owners —
          in this case the tea growers — and their international customers and
          partners can work to change an industry long stuck in its ways, while
          building resilience against the increasingly thorny challenges the
          changing climate presents.
        </p>

        <p>
          My spouse and sometimes travel companion Michele and (who you’ll
          recall from this earlier{" "}
          <a href="https://billspindle.substack.com/">post</a>) and I, arrived
          in Darjeeling in March. The gardens were just beginning their annual
          growing and picking cycle, the all-important first growth, or more
          poetically, ‘first flush.’ One of four pickings that take place before
          October, the first flush is the only one that follows a dormancy
          period, spanning the generally mild winter. Tiny, delicate leaves were
          appearing on tea bushes. The air was cool and the views picturesque —
          though, surprisingly, even to me after years experiencing India’s
          pollution elsewhere, smog from the plains far below obscured peaks
          throughout our stay. This included the near mythical Kanchenjunga,
          third-highest peak in the Himalayas (after Everest on the Nepal-China
          border and Pakistan’s K2). Kanchenjunga keeps a quiet vigil over the
          region, a constant presence to the local communities of Nepali-Indians
          who populate Darjeeling and work its tea fields.
        </p>
        <p>
          Darjeeling’s tea industry these days faces a typically troubling brew
          of human and climate-related problems. The biggest climate concerns
          are two-fold. The first is increasingly sporadic precipitation, long
          dry spells punctuated by violent waterfalls of rain or even barrages
          of thick hail, as opposed to the steady drizzle-to-downpour of the
          usual monsoon. The other is rising temperatures, particularly
          higher-than-average temperatures at night — a phenomenon occurring
          across the Himalayan range, sometimes known as the world’s “third
          pole.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Humans have made these problems worse. Industrial-scale illegal
          logging and deforestation from villagers in need of fuel for cooking
          and materials for construction have removed trees and foliage from
          most hillsides. With little left to hold the soil, landslides are
          common. Looking toward the city of Darjeeling across a valley, I could
          still see the scar of a massive landslide caused by a dumping of a
          month’s worth of rain there in a single day last October. Meanwhile,
          tea cultivation practices, developed by growers with little regard to
          nature itself, once removed all the weed and plant life below tea
          bushes leaving no layer of cool, green plant life to hold temperatures
          down.
        </p>

        />

        <p>
          Instead of exacerbating the problems climate change brings, the tea
          industry is realizing it needs to ameliorate them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Gautam Mohan, general manager of large-scale grower Tea Promoters
          India, is among a younger generation of estate owners determined to do
          just that. He’s overseen the installation of drains through the
          group’s gardens to capture and slow the huge volumes of water that run
          down the slopes during intense rain ‘bombs’. They’ve built bamboo
          frames to hold the soil in place. He’s been deeply involved in his
          estates’ transition to organic farming, an ambitious overhaul of
          almost every aspect of how the plantations operate, from substituting
          natural for manufactured fertilizers and eliminating chemical
          pesticides to nurturing swaths of uncultivated wilderness on their
          lands. The shift to organic methods got started at many plantations at
          the insistence of buyers in Europe, but many growers like Mohan have
          embraced the new methods as one of their best tools to build up the
          resilience of their bushes against new stresses from changing climate.
          For some, the efforts have become a sort of natural version of the
          kaizen — or “continuous improvement” — ethos that pervaded the
          Japanese auto industry I covered in the early 1990s.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Can more be done? Yes. Much more can be done,” says Mohan. “What are
          we doing to uphold our future and take charge of it? That’s where a
          lot of the answers lie. It’s doing it collectively where you get the
          real impact.”
        </p>

        <p>
          I recommend to anyone with a deeper interest in the region’s tea a
          delightful book I drew on extensively for my visit: Darjeeling, The
          Colorful History and Precarious Fate of the World’s Greatest Tea, by
          Jeff Koehler. Koehler tells the whole fascinating history of the
          region along with a thorough look at the industry’s current
          challenges. It includes a cast of characters worthy of the tea the
          region produces.

        <p>
          Michele and I spent much of our visit on gardens owned by the Chiabari
          and Ambootia groups, both of which have also gone organic. Krishnendu
          Chatterjee, who oversees Ambootia for a European investor group that
          owns Ambootia, says he has converted ten tea estates to organic
          farming in his career. When he arrives to begin an organic makeover —
          a years-long undertaking that involves transforming nearly every
          aspect of how an estate operates — he gathers the entire staff of the
          estate together to collectively create a compost heap. It symbolizes
          the new ethos of natural methods.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Everybody has to contribute a handful of vegetation to lay the
          foundation. Before you change anything else, you have to change human
          minds,” he says. “It’s not only good for the environment. It also
          makes the community better because they have a spirit of doing
          something good for the world.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Kaushik Das, who oversees five gardens for Ambootia (including one
          that dates back to the 1850s, the oldest in Darjeeling), let me tag
          along with him on his daily routine as the tea season swung into high
          gear at the Chongtong estate.
        </p>

        <p>
          We rode together in his four-wheel-drive up and down the slopes, from
          the fields where the tender first leaves were being plucked by hand,
          to the factory where they were carefully processed, to the “cow pack
          pit” where shells from organic eggs are ground up, mixed with cow
          dung, packed in a hollow cow horn, then buried to yield organic
          fertilizer brimming with microbial life.
        </p>

        <p>
          As we tooled our way toward his bungalow at the end of the day, he
          paused to reflect. “We believe that we are standing on the belly of
          mother earth,” he told me. “If we are doing good, there will be no
          upset. Our climate impact will go down.”
        </p>

          The brutal war in Ukraine and its reverberations across Europe are a
          long way from where my recent travels have taken me: the hills of
          Darjeeling, their slopes steeped in tea and nostalgia for the
          long-gone British Empire, and the fertile plain that spreads out
          between the city of Kolkata and the Himalayan foothills.

          Yet my encounters with two trains, one in each place, resonated with
          the thorny energy dilemmas the world faces in responding to Russian
          aggression. Namely, how do economies, systems and societies transition
          from one energy source (say, imported coal and natural gas) to others
          (like domestically available solar, wind and nuclear power) in a
          damned hurry?

          The first train encounter took me back in time to India’s coal-fired,
          colonial past on a steam locomotive through the storied hills of
          Darjeeling. The second transported me forward toward modern India’s
          decarbonized future: riding (even a short stint driving!) an electric
          locomotive of the sort that increasingly dominates India’s rail
          network.
        </p>

        <p>And what a rail network it is!</p>

        <p>
          This post also serves to introduce the Indian Railways, one of the
          world’s most remarkable institutions. The railway figures prominently
          in my journey from here on out. It’s how I am making my way around the
          subcontinent, and it occupies an important role in India’s transition
          from coal to clean electricity. It’s an institution that touches
          almost every part of India and virtually every Indian in some way.
        </p>

        <p>
          Among the oldest railroads in the world — and the first in Asia —
          Indian Railways transports more people, more places than any railway
          outside of China. Daily, that’s 23 million riders, along with 3
          million tons of freight. It’s like moving all of Australia every 24
          hours. Wholly owned by the government, Indian Railways operates 40,300
          miles of tracks, enough to go around the earth and then some. It’s one
          of the world’s largest employers, with 1.5 million workers. Its lines
          reach nearly every corner of the country, piercing jungles, scaling
          mountains, tracing coastlines, sprawling across dense cities and
          traversing fertile rural plains. Passengers are from all walks,
          migrant laborers traveling to and returning home from far away jobs,
          bureaucrats making their daily commute, farmers toting produce to city
          bazaars, inspectors bound for rural villages, soldiers commissioned to
          far-flung posts, and the pious on the country’s never-ending
          pilgrimage circuit. Railway freight is the lifeblood of the economy:
          grains and lentils, kernels and bulbs, clothes and textiles,
          appliances, cement, chemicals, cars, coal.

        <p>
          Indian Railways is also the largest single energy consumer in India,
          as recently as 2017 guzzling up as much as 2.6 billion liters of
          diesel fuel and 18 trillion watts of power a year. That’s more than 3%
          of the country’s entire consumption of diesel and about 2% of its
          electricity. Were Indian railways a country, that sort of energy
          consumption would rank it among the top 100 consuming nations.
        </p>

        <p>
          The history of the railway is the story of India becoming a modern
          nation. And to the extent the railway is a microcosm of India, it can
          help explain three things:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The inevitability of energy transition now that the incentives are
            in place.
          </li>
          <li>
            Why transitions like these usually take so long and are so
            devilishly complicated.
          </li>
          <li>How the transition can be accelerated.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So, all aboard!</p>

        <p>
          With so much romance shrouding memories of the steam locomotive, it’s
          easy to forget why the first ones in India were dubbed “Fire
          Chariots.” There’s a small inferno in its belly, driving it. Though
          engineering feats for their time, these are seriously noisy,
          smoke-belching, sooty, coal-dust-smeared machines.
        </p>

        <p>
          That becomes obvious when you board a rail carriage behind one, as my
          wife, Michele, and I did in Darjeeling. We took what’s billed as the
          tourist “joy ride” from the former colonial hill town up to the city
          of Ghum, which hosts the highest train station in the world at 2,258
          meters (7,407 feet). The line runs on a track gauge so narrow that the
          locomotive is commonly referred to as the “Toy Train.” The locomotive
          and two cars cut a vertiginous path along ridges and through hillside
          towns and villages. Once the workhorses of India’s rail system, only a
          handful of steam locomotives operate today, all of them tourist
          attractions like the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway we rode. The line,
          launched in 1881, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eager riders packed into the two carriages pulled by our locomotive.
          The experience was certainly redolent of India’s colonial history,
          with the difference that it’s now fully owned, operated and, in these
          days of Covid, ridden almost entirely by Indians. But we could also
          understand the disappointment expressed by many a Trip Advisor
          reviewer that the line segment currently operating offers few majestic
          views — due to overbuilding along the tracks — and almost constant,
          ear-piercing whistle shrieks aimed at pedestrian and auto traffic on
          the road the train runs along.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an experience mainly for rail aficionados and connoisseurs of
          colonialism — as well, perhaps, as the occasional reporter looking for
          historical perspective on energy transition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coal-fired steam locomotives have become novelties for a reason:
          cleaner, cheaper, better technologies followed, replacing them. India
          imported its first diesel locomotive from the U.S. in 1957, ten years
          after it won its independence. And for decades diesel dominated
          India’s railways. Yet coal-fired steam hardly disappeared overnight.
          The last steam locomotive — dubbed the Antim Sitara, or “The Last
          Star” — was made in 1970. India retired its last working steam
          locomotive in 1995.

          Nearly all the while, another contender was slowly rising: electric
          locomotives. The first in India rolled out of what was known as
          Victoria Terminus Station in Bombay in 1925. The first electric
          locomotive built in India was commisioned in 1961, only four years
          after the import of that first diesel locomotive.
        </p>
        <p>
          But only quite recently has Indian Railways begun deploying electric
          locomotives at a record clip — because now they’re the cornerstone of
          the government’s plan to go green. By the end of this year, electric
          locomotives should be running on virtually all Indian Railways’ main
          lines. This is why I stopped outside Kolkata to visit the Chittaranjan
          Locomotive Works, India’s most storied locomotive plant.
        </p>
        <p>
          CLW, as the factory and testing ground are known, built India’s first
          domestic steam locomotives. Before that, the Indian colonial
          administration, known as the Raj, imported all of them from mother
          ship Britain. CLW also made that first electric locomotive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chittaranjan is basically a company town — along the lines of Toyota
          City in Japan, the hometown of Toyota Motors, which I visited when I
          covered the Japanese auto industry in the 1990s. Except that while
          Toyota City is a bit of an industrialized car town, Chittaranjan
          remains an oddly bucolic enclave where close to 50,000 workers and
          their families live, attend school, and take part in all manner of
          community activities, from cricket to traditional Hindi language
          poetry.
        </p>
        <p>
          The community was purpose-built, ordered up by India’s first prime
          minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, having helped throw off its colonial
          masters the previous year. Nehru visited several times, one of a
          parade of international notables who came for a look, including
          Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev,
          Chinese premier Chou En-Lai, Egyptian and Yugoslavian strongmen Gamal
          Abdul Nasser and Marshall Tito, even the Dalai Lama.

          CLW just finished producing a record 486 locomotives in the past year,
          all of them electric. The company believes this could be more
          locomotives manufactured in a single plant in a year than ever in
          history — and plans to apply to the Guinness World Records to prove
          it. The company’s general manager, S.K. Kashyup, told me the factory
          plans make 540 more this year, about half of all the locomotives that
          will be made in India. The railway ministry, indeed the entire
          government, has made electrification of the railway a pillar of
          efforts to meet their goal to decarbonize the economy by 2070. So far,
          the railway has electrified about 85% of the most heavily used lines
          in the network. During my tour of the CLW’s cavernous workshop, I even
          drove one of these 125-ton electric locomotives (with a lifelong CLW
          test engineer at my side!). They are quiet, clean and remarkably easy
          to drive (at least for the roughly one-tenth of a mile I was at the
          helm!). By the end of next year nearly all major lines will be
          electrified.
        </p>
        <p>So is mission go-green accomplished then?</p>
        <p>
          This is where the devilish complexity starts. Electrifying the
          locomotives is only step one. To get India off coal, now come the hard
          parts. Since two-thirds of India’s overall electrical generation comes
          from coal, electrifying locomotives just swaps one fossil fuel,
          diesel, for another, the coal that creates the electricity. Phasing
          out coal from India’s energy mix is a much more difficult challenge,
          given the scale of total electricity demand and the tens of millions
          of Indian livelihoods that depend on the coal industry itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if trains run on electricity, at at least that’s no longer Indian
          Railways’ problem, right? Unfortunately, the demise of coal will
          create another, almost bigger problem for Indian railways. Since its
          earliest days, coal has been the biggest and most profitable freight
          that the Indian railway carts around. Indeed, the railway overcharges
          for coal freight, so that it can undercharge for basic passenger
          fares. Indians tend to see this as both fair to legions of poor and
          lower-middle class riders and critical for an economy that
          incorporates a lots of domestic migrant labor requiring cheap travel.
        </p>
        <p>
          As renewable energy pushes coal out of the power generation system,
          the corresponding drop in coal freight will eventually lead to big
          problems with railway finances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay, you say, then just stop the cross-subsidization and make
          passenger fares reflect the cost of passenger travel? Well, that is
          easier said than done. This is because the railway is government
          owned, an essential public service and… India is a democracy. Every
          one of the 23 million daily riders — who don’t want to pay higher
          ticket fares — is a voter. As are all 1.5 million employees, many of
          whom belong to unions close to political parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can see how all this gets very complicated for the politicians,
          who have a lot of influence over the railway. We’ll dig into some of
          that complexity — which runs through India’s entire energy economy —
          in future posts.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, suffice it to say this complexity is why energy transitions
          take so long, left to their own devices. Yet this energy transition
          must happen fast. It cannot be left to its own devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          What new devices then? That’s where we come back to the critical,
          cross-border cooperation needed between the developed world — which
          has the capital needed to smooth out rocky adjustments such as these —
          and a developing world with entirely reasonable and growing energy
          demand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deals need to be made for the good of all. A radical step-up in
          investment from developed countries into the developing world is
          urgent and long overdue, not only in renewable energy but also to help
          phase out coal power generation in a hurry. Indian leaders are quietly
          realizing how much they’ll ultimately waste by pushing on with coal,
          but neither do they have the sums needed, up front, to retire coal
          generating plants early and keep up with power demand. Wealthy
          countries are, maybe, starting to grasp just how much it will cost
          later to address climate impacts from continued use of coal.
          Ultimately cheaper, definitely wiser, and simply the right thing to
          do, wealthy countries should fund now what developing countries
          cannot.
        </p>
        <p>
          The benefit would be a gain for all. Otherwise, the toll on everyone
          will be far larger later.

          Nearly every tea plantation in India has adopted at least some organic
          farming methods to build resilience of their crops, in part against
          the growing ravages of climate change. At Nuxalbari Tea Estate in the
          Dooars region of West Bengal, Sonia Jabbar views organic farming
          methods as just one part of a wider effort to reintroduce elements of
          nature, wilderness, to the estate. That means everything from reviving
          microbial life in the soil to welcoming some considerably larger
          visitors (see above tweet). Sonia, as you’ll hear, is something of a
          force of nature herself, the only woman who both owns and runs —
          hands-on, day-to-day — a tea estate in India.

          Here’s one of the bigger ironies of my journey through India reporting
          on climate change and energy transition:
        </p>
        <p>
          I traveled more than 5,000 miles by rail, virtually all of it on
          trains pulled by electrified locomotives; yet where ever I went I saw
          coal piled high on railway cars pulled by those same electric
          locomotives. The paradox captures the tricky turning point India and
          the world have reached in the transition from fossil fuels to
          renewable energy, primarily solar and wind.
        </p>

          The Indian Railways, India’s largest energy consumer, has transitioned
          its fleet of locomotives to electricity not to save the world nor to
          “go green” for purposes of publicity (though the railway and Indian
          government love to boast about it). This transition, long ago from
          coal to diesel and more recently from diesel to electric, happened
          because it saves the railway billions annually on the cost of diesel
          fuel, nearly all of which India must import.

          My visit to the Chittaranjan Locomotive Works, after a ride on one of
          the last coal-fired trains on the planet, underscored how far the
          railway has come — and how far it has to go.

          Despite going electric, has the railway really weaned itself off
          fossil fuels? Well, no. Since more than two-thirds of India’s
          electricity is generated from coal, that’s more or less the proportion
          of the electricity the railway is drawing on for its new power source.
          Now, since electrical propulsion is considerably more efficient than
          diesel power, progress is being made.
        </p>
        <p>
          But India’s larger dependence on coal is amply underscored by the long
          chains of coal transport rakes I passed in my travels.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a spring heat wave and India’s economic bounceback from Covid
          lockdowns strained the country’s power grid, the railway has scrambled
          to race coal supplies to thermal power generation plants across the
          nation to limit power cuts. This is good business for the railway.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coal remains the railway’s single largest and most profitable freight
          class — another way the Indian Railways remains, like the rest of the
          country, highly dependent on coal.

          The Russian invasion of Ukraine this year has cost India tens of
          billions of dollars as turmoil in the oil market has pushed up prices
          — even for countries, like India, willing to purchase discounted
          Russian oil
        </p>
        <p>
          That has India — like Europe, albeit to a lesser and more
          self-tortured extent — looking favorably on coal. Where Europe is
          extending the operations of some coal generators it had planned to
          phase out, India is newly considering expansions to its coal fleet.
          Both moves are a nod to the growing concerns countries everywhere have
          about energy security amid the energy transition and a more turbulent
          geopolitical environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those worries can’t be dismissed, with parts of Europe at war and
          tensions rising in Asia over Taiwan. They will persist as long as the
          world remains deeply dependent on fossil fuels, whether it’s Russian
          gas piped to Europe or Saudi Arabian oil shipped through the South
          China Sea.

          Still, the flip side of the Indian rail coal paradox shouldn’t be
          forgotten. Indian Railways transitioned from coal to diesel to
          electric because it made financial sense. With the cost of renewable
          energy in India now well below that of coal — and practicalities such
          as how to store some of that energy for use when the sun isn’t shining
          and the wind isn’t blowing being worked out — many of Indian Railway’s
          coal customers will eventually figure out how to phase out coal as
          well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The government is already pushing renewable energy hard, upping
          incentives for solar and wind power and rolling out an ambitious plan
          to become a global player in green hydrogen production. Green hydrogen
          is derived from solar and wind power and can then burned cleanly or
          stored.
        </p>
        <p>
          Renewable energy is growing rapidly in India, faster than every other
          major country in the past year. It will grow even faster from here on.
          The country is aiming for half its electricity to be produced by
          non-fossil resources by 2030. Because the country’s electricity
          consumption is also growing fast — on the order of 6% a year — coal
          won’t likely go into decline by then.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as with the railway, the gears will be well in motion to send coal
          into terminal decline not long after that, perhaps at a pace far
          faster than many now foresee.

          Ah, to be an Indian power consumer during election season. The offers
          of free electricity — for farmers! for the poor! for everybody! — come
          in from all sides.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I passed through India’s biggest state earlier this year,
          political parties were competing furiously in a poll that would
          determine control over the mega-state. Uttar Pradesh, located in
          India’s north, has a population of 280 million, enough to rank it as
          the world’s fourth-most populous country. The stakes are enormous
          here, locally and nationally. Uttar Pradesh is so big, and so
          influential within India’s political economy, how and when the energy
          transition happens here matters on a global scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          The campaigns underscored perhaps the biggest challenge facing India’s
          clean energy transition: the politics of the country’s energy market.

          As I hopped between campaign rallies and interviews with electricity
          industry players, the parties touted the electricity giveaways they
          vowed to enact and the industry players lamented the fiscal mess this
          would ensure continues. Uttar Pradesh’s main opposition party was
          promising 300 kilowatt hours of free power monthly for all — enough to
          cover what poor and lower middle class families consume — while
          assuring around-the-clock power (i.e. considerably more than the 12-18
          hours many consumers live with now); Another opposition party seconded
          that, and upped the ante by promising to waive past electricity bills
          (and there are many, as non-payment is endemic).
        </p>
        <p>
          The dominant Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which controls both the
          state and India’s central government and thus has the most incentive
          to restrain itself, nonetheless assured farmers they would continue to
          receive free electricity for irrigation, as they have for decades.
          Farmers are the most powerful voting bloc, in Uttar Pradesh and
          nationally, so cannot be ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
          The electricity sops — resembling those in nearly every state election
          across the country — underscore India’s long-standing view of
          electricity: something between a hallowed right of citizenship and a
          political gift in exchange for votes. This has led to a chronically
          loss-making power sector and a utility industry bankrupt on an epic
          scale.

        <p>
          Not everyone benefits from the freebies. Business and industry are
          determinedly over-charged. Farmers, on the other hand, enjoy almost
          completely free power. Urban households are systematically
          undercharged. Cheating and outright power theft — often by illegally
          tapping into suspended power lines — are widely tolerated. By official
          admission, between one-fifth and a third of power goes unpaid for.
          Knowledgeable officials told me the real figures are likely higher
          since huge swaths of consumption are not metered, more or less by
          design.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result is eye-watering debts at the utilities. Nationally, these
          currently total some 1.1 trillion rupees, roughly $13 billion. Known
          in India as “discoms,” short for distribution companies, these
          utilities buy power from generating companies and sell it to
          consumers. Discoms are controlled by state electricity boards, which
          in turn are controlled by politicians. The central government has come
          up with several schemes to improve profitability and wipe out these
          debts. So far they have not worked.
        </p>
        <p>
          This might be starting to change — indeed, has changed in a few states
          — in part because of the rapidly falling cost of renewable energy. But
          progress is very slow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Uttar Pradesh is home to some of the worst-performing discoms. They
          pay some of the highest prices in the nation to generators. They are
          among the worst in the nation at getting customers to pay them. Not
          coincidentally, Uttar Pradesh has lagged in adopting wind and solar
          energy, despite solid wind and solar resources.
        </p>

        <p>
          Why does it pay so much to generators? Anticipating a power crunch in
          2010s, the state signed a series of costly, multi-decade contracts
          with electricity generators operating coal-fired plants. These require
          payments even if their electricity isn’t needed. So when renewable
          electricity generators came along a few years later, they got
          short-shrift even though their power was cheaper than coal-generated
          power. Over time, however, the price gap has grown into a chasm as the
          cost of renewable energy has plunged by more than 90% over the past
          decade while the price of coal power has, at best, stayed the same and
          in some cases risen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cost savings have become so tempting, finally, that the political
          dynamics are starting to slowly change. Renewable energy is gaining
          momentum in the state. Discoms are beginning to feed it into the grid,
          saving money even after paying the coal generators for energy they
          don’t produce. More renewable energy is coming.
        </p>

          The state is still almost fully powered by more-expensive coal, all of
          which must be shipped in from out of state. But at least one of the
          state’s five discoms is working to improve bill collections from
          customers, a first step toward building revenues. These revenues at
          least in theory, can be invested in more lower-cost renewable
          generation over time, thus saving more money and helping close the
          profitability gap.
        </p>
        <p>
          That could help set in motion a game-changing virtual cycle: cheaper
          renewable energy creating the funds to improve service and billing,
          which produces more revenues, allowing still more investments in
          renewable energy that save more money. The main thing standing in the
          way is politics.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Political interference in the power sector leads to lower revenues
          and far more capital expenditure than required,” decried Avadhesh
          Verma, who runs the state’s largest electricity consumer protection
          group.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried to meet with the discom supposedly making progress on
          improving both service levels and raising revenues. A consultant
          working with the company assured me that the company is seeing
          “fantastic outcomes.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But in a sign of just how resistant the free-electricity poltical
          flywheel is to systemic change, neither the discom nor the consultant
          wanted to publicize their successes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Likely they know better than to brag about sticking their hand in the
          gears.

          Few cities are as polluted as Delhi, and even fewer with the size of
          its population, approaching 30 million people. The Yamuna River, which
          runs through the megalopolis, consistently ranks among the most
          despoiled waterways in the world. The pollution in the 900 mile
          waterway comes mainly from Delhi, which contributes up to about 80% of
          the pollutants despite taking in about 2% of the river’s length.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet Dr. Faiyaz Khudsar, a professor of biology at The University of
          Delhi, gave us a tour of an extraordinary stretch of the river.

          Like Dr. Krishna Ray, who we met earlier in the journey working to
          restore mangrove habitats in India’s Sundarbans, Khudsar studied under
          Prof. C.R. Babu. Babu trained many of India’s prominent environmental
          scientists, including Ray’s spouse, another botonist whose research
          has focused on restoring Himalayan ecosystems. Babu pioneered many of
          the principles of what he calls “reconstructing” severely degraded
          natural habitats. As we saw with Ray’s work in the Sundarbans, it
          takes many years and often starts with grasses that gradually change
          the microbial and chemical composition of the soil so that other
          native species can re-establish themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          “This is the only way to preserve the natural heritage in urban
          centers, where most of nature has been wiped away,” Babu told me
          before we set off on our visit of the park.
        </p>
        <p>
          Khudsar’s enthusiasm for this patch of nature he’s helped restore is
          infectious, and comes through in this similar tour available on
          YouTube.

          As the native flora and fauna gradually returned over the two decades,
          Khudsar says larger ecosystem rallied.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Species we lost 100 years ago started coming back and breeding,” he
          said, including Hog Deer, wild pigs, snakes and Horned Owls.

          One day in 2016, a leopard — common in the area more than a century
          ago — showed up. This thrilled Khudsar: proof the habitat had reached
          maturity. But when the leopard killed two goats outside the park,
          wildlife authorities trapped it and brought it to a reserve far from
          urban populations.

          “It was ready to stay, but the forest department wasn’t happy with so

        <p>Clean lines. Sharp edges. Platonic forms.</p>
        <p>This is India? Well, sort of.</p>
        <p>
          Squaring the oh-so-orderly city of Chandigarh with the sprawling,
          chaotic, bursting-with-life urban spaces in the rest of India is no
          simple task. The dual capital of two states — Punjab and Haryana —
          Chandigarh is at once the country’s most deliberately planned city and
          one that exists altogether apart from India today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chandigarh was conceived by independent India’s first leader,
          Jawaharlal Nehru, as a futuristic, utopian experiment in the aftermath
          of the violent partition that created two nations from Britain’s
          Indian empire in 1947. With Lahore, the capital of the Punjab region
          under British rule, ending up in Pakistan, India needed a new state
          seat for the Punjab region that remained behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new capital was planned, and its construction overseen, by
          Westerners: the Swiss-French architect/designer/urban planning giant
          Charles-Edouard Jeanneret, better known as Le Corbusier, and his
          cousin Pierre Jeanneret. They were contracted in 1950 by the Nehru-led
          government.
        </p>
        <p>
          My wife and I spent a week in Chandigarh, which had somehow eluded my
          widespread travels throughout the country during the four years I was
          posted there with The Wall Street Journal. The city is everything the
          rest of India’s urban spaces are not — organized, open, attentive to
          its public spaces, full of trees and only mildly burdened by traffic
          congestion.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many lessons the rest of India could take from Chandigarh’s
          meticulous city plan and the strict municipal zoning enforcement that
          assures its preservation. As the head of the city’s environmental
          department pointed out, almost no other cities are seeing population
          and automobile ownership rise at the same time they are increasing the
          area devoted to open space and parkland.
        </p>

        <br></br>
        <p>
          City leadership has worked particularly well with the population to
          inculcate pride and engagement in preserving and improving on parks
          and green spaces. During early morning strolls around the city, I
          found the city’s numerous parks full of joggers and walkers, yoga
          practitioners and badminton players.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the rest of India relies on dirty coal for nearly three-quarters
          of its electricity, Chandigarh is aiming for 100% renewable
          electricity provision by 2030, Debendra Dalia, the environmental
          department chief, told me. That’s achievable in part because of the
          availability of hydropower from dams located nearby in the Himalaya
          mountains, which are visible from Chandigarh. But the municipality is
          also making strides installing rooftop solar, not only on government
          and office complexes but also residential buildings.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s the result of generous net-metering policies, allowing
          households to sell power back into the electricity grid when their
          panels generate more than needed. The public transport system is
          changing over to electric buses gradually, and there are plans to
          install 100 charging stations for electric cars in the next two years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet ultimately the lessons Chandigarh has for the rest of India are
          limited. The city’s population has grown dramatically along with the
          rest of India, of course. Some 1.2 million live there, up from the
          150,000 original residents the city was designed to accommodate.

        <p>
          That growth, however, doesn’t account for even more rapid population
          expansion outside the boundaries of the planned city. Yet this is
          where many of the administrators, bureaucrats and every day workers
          that make Chandigarh tick live. In that sense, the city has managed to
          simply wall itself off from the growth challenges most Indian cities
          face, while still drawing the benefit of the labor pool from those
          peripheral areas. In other words, Chandigarh is displacing problems
          rather than solving them. The most obvious example is the lack of a
          regional rail or subway system — long resisted by the city’s wealthy
          residents, even as their economy depends largely on workers from
          outlying areas.

          This is why other metropolitan areas have taken the lead in wrangling
          with the full and daunting challenges that rapid urbanization and
          climate change present for Indian cities. We’ll visit two of these in
          future posts, the western city of Surat in the state of Gujarat and
          the southern city of Chennai in Tamil Nadu state.
        </p>

        <p>
          Both are increasingly exploring more flexible, so-called
          “nature-based” solutions that attempt to both accomodate the expansion
          of India’s urban population and address the growing threats from
          climate change.

          Much of India’s northwest is a scorching, windswept expanse of desert
          — precisely what the country’s renewable energy companies love about
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the state of Rajasthan, I visited the Bhadla solar park, among the
          largest in the world. ACME Group, one of India’s largest renewable
          energy companies, brought me out to visit the section of the expanse
          of arrays the company operates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beneath an unrelenting sun, solar panals covered the scrubby plain for
          as far as I could see. It was May, and afternoon temperatures already
          topped 120 degrees fahrenheit. It was easy to understand why Rajasthan
          has installed more solar capacity than any other Indian state. The
          state racked up almost half of all the renewable energy built in India
          through August, according to statistics compiled by Ember.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just days later and a few hundred miles away in the state of Gujarat,
          I stared up at wind towers operated by another of India’s biggest
          renewable energy companies, ReNew Power. Gujarat, the other powerhost
          of India’s renewable energy boom, hosted almost two-thirds of the 1.1
          gigawatts of new wind generation built in the country through August.

          India has few crude oil deposits and little natural gas. Coal is
          plentiful, and at the moment the government is scrambling to mine and
          even import more of it. But burning coal contributes to global warming
          and has helped leave India with some of the most polluted air on the
          planet. Global prices for oil, natural gas and coal are soaring as the
          war in Ukraine scrambles supplies and the global economic bounce back
          from Covid has boosted demand. Yet despite the desperate scramble for
          fossil fuels — or, more accurately, because of it — their long-term
          appeal is waning rapidly. India would like nothing better than an
          alternative to dependence on volatile global energy markets.

          “This is going to open up a whole lot of room for renewable energy,”
          says Sumant Sinha, the chairman and chief executive of ReNew Power,
          one of India’s leading renewable energy developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          India has already expanded renewable energy faster than any other
          large country in the past decade. Solar power capacity has grown
          60-fold in a decade, stunning industry insiders and skeptical
          observers alike. India has already installed almost 20% more renewable
          capacity so far this year than it did all of last year, bringing the
          total to more than 120 gigawatts. The government aims to install much,
          much more. India has publicly committed to producing half its power
          from renewable sources by 2030. That’s likely to mean adding at least
          three times more capacity, requiring the country to move
          two-and-a-half times faster in installing renewables in the time
          remaining.

        <p>
          What’s driving this expansion? Few countries have benefited more from
          plummeting renewable energy costs over the past two decades.
        </p>
        <p>
          India began growing solar installations around 2010, a decade after
          Germany kicked off the world’s first huge renewable energy push.
          Between 2008 and 2013, Germany increased its solar generating capacity
          six fold — at first relying on German solar panel manufacturers, but
          then increasingly turning to Chinese makers. Chinese manufacturers,
          backed by a torrent of government subsidies, cut prices aggressively,
          scooping up orders from Germany and eventually China’s own burgeoning
          solar installations. This won them economies of scale and drove costs
          ever lower.
        </p>
        <p>
          The winning bids marched relentlessly lower, to a record-low 1.99
          rupees in one auction in 2020 from as much as 18 rupees per kilowatt
          hour in 2010. This stunning 89 percent drop beat the overall worldwide
          decline of about 80 percent. Wind projects saw similar, if not quite
          as steep, cost reductions of more than 50 percent.
        </p>
        <p>
          India suddenly had some of the lowest prices for renewables on the
          planet. At the landmark Paris Conference of 2015, India put renewables
          at the center of its energy expansion plans.

        <p>
          That push, however, still leaves the future of coal, which accounts
          for two-thirds of India’s power generating capacity, hanging in the
          balance. Coal can decline precipitously after 2030 only if India meets
          its renewable energy goals, and then utilizes that foundation to push
          green energy to still far higher levels after that.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s a daunting task. It will require overcoming homegrown stumbling
          blocks such as the staggering debts of electric utilities as well as
          the international challenge of weaning itself off what India now sees
          as a dangerous dependence on Chinese solar equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 2018 solar power reached a historic milestone, beating out coal to
          become India’s least expensive energy source. That was huge — even
          though solar and wind couldn’t yet replace coal because they’re
          available only when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing. Last
          year, India was the world’s best emerging market for investment in
          renewables, in a ranking by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet India’s historic push into renewables has reached a challenging
          juncture. One of the biggest beneficiaries of plummeting renewable
          energy costs over the past decade, India’s green energy push must now
          traverse a landscape of new obstacles and opportunities. These include
          sweeping changes in the dynamics of global trade and energy security
          sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as domestic
          challenges to accelerating the growth of renewables.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, renewable costs will likely remain well below the cost of coal,
          especially the higher quality coal India must import from places like
          Indonesia and Australia, industry officials say. Indeed, for the first
          time, India is beginning to view renewable energy not just as
          low-cost, but also as a route to more energy independence and even a
          shot at becoming a significant energy exporter someday.
        </p>
        <p>
          To eventually replace coal, however, renewables will need to deliver
          power on demand, around the clock and in forms that can fuel
          industrial processes like cement and steel manufacturing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as the Indian government is wielding carrots and sticks to spur
          solar panel manufacturing, it has launched a major new program to
          incentivise the manufacture and utilization of storage systems. And it
          is pushing a plan to spur the production of green hydrogen from
          renewable energy at a massive scale. The government is also aiming to
          expand wind energy production off India’s extensive coastline,
          attempting again to ride a wave of falling global costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first large-scale storage projects are still on the drawing
          boards, but they have been tendered and are underway.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Once you have round-the-clock renewables, that’s renewables plus
          storage, that are viable, then that’s the end of the story for fossil
          fuels,” India’s Power and Renewable Energy Minister Raj Kumar Singh
          recently told an international audience.

          The collection of pipes, pumps and an electrolyzer outside the ancient
          city of Bikaner is tiny for an industrial facility. But this is among
          the seeds that will eventually grow into a branch of the energy
          industry worth hundreds of billions of dollars globally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Few emerging energy technologies have been hailed as far and wide as
          green hydrogen. The process starts with water, adds electricity and
          results in a fuel, hydrogen, that simply reverts back to water and
          oxygen when used as an energy source. When made with renewable energy,
          it’s clean as a whistle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hydrogen can be stored for months in the form of ammonia, a chemical
          compound the world already regularly deals with in its liquid form. In
          this guise, hydrogen can also be shipped relatively easily. It can
          also be conveniently manufactured when wind and solar electricity
          production exceed demand during peak sunshine. Hydrogen burns hot, so
          it can replace dirty coking coal in steel plants. There’s already a
          large market for hydrogen in oil refining and to make agricultural
          fertilizers. It’s just dirty hydrogen — meaning produced through a
          process that emits lots of carbon dioxide — that could be replaced by
          the green stuff, if it can be made cheap enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Fertilizers and chemicals are markets that are already there, they
          just need to move from grey to green,” said Devang Singh, an ACME exec
          who showed me around.

        <p>
          Industry experts are confident hydrogen can be made cheap enough — as
          long as we make a lot of it. Indeed, with the huge spike in natural
          gas prices over the past year green hydrogen may already be cheap
          enough. And it’s going to get much cheaper.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of that has raised hopes that green hydrogen will help with some
          of the toughest challenges of the energy transition: storing green
          energy and cleaning up industries like fertilizer production, steel
          making, shipping and perhaps even aviation.

          I toured this pilot project, operated by ACME Group, one of India’s
          leading renewable energy companies, earlier this year when it was the
          only operating commercial green hydrogen facility in the world. ACME
          set up the plant in early 2021. By the middle of that year, it was
          deploying five megawatts of solar energy to power a single 2.5
          Megawatt electrolyzer. The plant makes five tons of green ammonia per
          day.

        <p>
          From this, and a handful of other pilot projects around the world
          today, a massive industry will rise. According to the International
          Energy Agency’s (IEA) at least eight megatons of hydrogen to green
          ammonia production capacity is planned worldwide, one and a half
          million times what’s being produced in Bikaner. More broadly, the
          International Renewable Energy Agency projects that more than
          one-tenth of the energy the world consumes in 2050 could come from
          hydrogen. Much of that will come from places like India — and
          Australia and Chile, North Africa and the Western United States — that
          have plentiful cheap renewable energy that can drive up volume and
          push down costs. Some of India’s biggest companies have jumped on the
          hydrogen bandwagon, including Reliance Industries, Adani Group,
          national power company NTCP, Renew Energy and Indian Oil Co. They’re
          leveraging India’s sun-drenched northwest deserts and other prime
          solar energy sites. ACME has announced a $7 billion investment to a
          plant in Karnataka state in southern India, another hot spot for clean
          energy production. Many of them are already looking abroad for
          markets, as well. ACME is building a plant in Oman that will deploy
          60-70 electrolyzers to produce six times as much ammonia as the
          Bikaner plant. Virtually all of it will be exported to places like
          Europe and Japan, transforming Oman’s main exports from oil to
          hydrogen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project in Bikaner is a learning exercise. Right now, green
          ammonia is at least double the price of ammonia produced through the
          conventional methodology, which produces large amounts of carbon
          dioxide. But many experts believe the industry is on the same sort of
          turbo-learning curve that has sent solar power and battery storage
          costs tumbling by 80-90% in recent years. Reliance, for example, is
          aiming to cut the cost of green hydrogen to less than a dollar by
          2030, and is investing some $70 billion into green hydrogen to do it.
          The company plans to replace its current production of hydrogen made
          the dirty way, with natural gas, in its refineries (the biggest of
          which you’ll recall we visited earlier). That would help India
          massively reduce the amount it pays each year to import natural gas.

          We’ve spent considerable time in India’s sunny and windy northwest as
          part our ongoing climate and energy journey through the subcontinent.
          The region has a key place in India’s energy landscape and critical
          role in its energy transition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The northwest is home-base for India’s current oil-and-gas industry,
          but also hosts the country’s fastest-growing renewables staging
          ground. The state of Gujarat will help determine whether manufacturing
          jobs grow as part of the renewables revolution, and what role India’s
          ambitions in hydrogen will play in the energy transition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before leaving, though, I wanted to make one more point about the
          global renewable energy economy that is now developing. A big driver
          of renewable energy growth these days is energy security. This is a
          direct result of the war in Ukraine. But it doesn’t mean we’re headed
          for a world of national energy islands operating alone, but rather one
          likely interrelated in new and perhaps healthier ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Countries in Europe and beyond have woken up to energy security as one
          of the biggest benefits of renewable energy. This is especially true
          in Europe, which is experiencing the vulnerability that came with
          dependence on an energy partner as antagonistic as Russia. The EU
          imported 40% of its gas and 30% of its oil from Russia before the war.
          Six months later, that’s down to less than 10% for gas and headed
          toward zero for oil with a ban on Russian imports phasing in from
          earlier this month. The lesson has not been lost on China and India,
          the world’s first and third-largest energy consuming countries and the
          two biggest importers of energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          These energy consumers have responded partly by reembracing coal,
          something they all produce to some extent, particularly India and
          China. But however zealously they’re turning back to the dirtiest of
          fossil fuels in this pinch — really zealously in the case of India and
          China, less so in the case of the EU — it’s also obvious none of them
          see coal as more than a short-term, or at best medium-term, fix.

          A better solution, they all realize, is a massive, historic move to
          renewables. The International Energy Agency just upped its global
          forecast for renewable energy to 85% growth over the next five years,
          almost one-third faster than it was predicting before Russia’s Ukraine
          invasion. Europe is leading the charge. It’s aiming for 45% of its
          energy to come from renewables by 2030, up from the 40% it was
          shooting for before the invasion. China has raised its renewable
          capacity targets by 35% over last year’s plans, the IEA says, and will
          account for fully half the new renewable energy capacity installed
          globally over the next five years. India could double renewable energy
          capacity in that time. And the US, the world’s largest producer and
          second-largest consumer of fossil energy, will be installing twice as
          much renewable energy annually in 2027 due to the climate and
          infrastructure programs the Biden administration passed this year,
          according to the IEA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, none of this means the world we are headed for won’t include
          trade in energy — and not just lingering trade in fossil fuels during
          the decades needed for a transition to clean energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I visited Gujarat state’s Climate Change Department, one of the
          things the man in charge, joint secretary B.H. Talati, wanted to talk
          about was importing and exporting renewable electricity. Certainly,
          his near-term focus was building up Gujarat’s renewable energy
          capacity. He said Gujarat expects to be producing 100 gigawatts of
          renewable power by 2030 — far more energy than the state will be
          consuming. That means lots of power would be shipped outside the
          state, at first to other parts of India via a dedicated “green
          beltway” high-voltage transmission line.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Talati also said the aim is to eventually link up the Indian power
          grid with renewable power overseas, in the United Arab Emirates and
          Saudi Arabia to the west and to Southeast Asian countries such as
          Thailand, Myanmar and Singapore to the east. This reflects Indian
          Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “One Sun, One Grid, One World”
          initiative — OSOGOW, for the initiated! — a vision India’s leader has
          been promoting since the Paris Climate conference as part of an
          initiative called the National Solar Alliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seven years on, it’s still just an idea, but an intriguing one:
          like-minded countries could join their power grids, allowing countries
          that can produce lots of renewable energy — far beyond their own
          needs, particularly at certain times of the day — to ship that power
          overseas when it’s most needed. The idea is just one of several
          initiatives — some actually in the works — for sending renewable
          energy from places where it’s most easily produced to places that need
          it. One project is planning to ship solar power from Australia’s
          northwest — one of the sunniest regions in the world — to Singapore
          via an undersea cable. Another would send solar power from a desert in
          Morocco — one of many prime solar hotspots in North Africa — to the
          United Kingdom.

        <span>Sun Cable Corp’s project would traverse Southeast Asia</span>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Among the benefits of such projects would be the ability to better
          match supply and demand for power. In theory, the late afternoon solar
          power produced in Gujarat could be used to meet electricity demand in
          Singapore after dark. After the sun sets in India, it would then turn
          to the Arab Gulf for solar-generated power, while the Gulf could turn
          to North Africa once the sun sets on solar panels in Saudi and the
          UAE. Europe and the UK, which need imported power throughout much of
          the day, would draw from North Africa’s sun-soaked deserts pretty much
          full time.
        </p>
        <p>
          These projects are obviously complicated and could prove to be too
          expensive. The Australia-to-Singapore transmission cable, which is
          furthest along in the planning stages, is pegged at $22 billion and
          could power as many as three million homes, providing 15% of the city
          state’s electricity needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, of course, these sorts of cross-border energy flows would
          reintroduce some of the same vulnerabilities as good old fossil fuels.
          The cables could be sabotaged, just as two gas pipelines from Russia
          to Europe were blown up earlier this year. And countries would have to
          be mindful of linking up with countries with which they’re not on
          friendly terms, a la Europe’s gas ties to Russia. But this sort of
          cooperation could work the other way, cementing ties between friendly
          countries in the same way “friend-shoring” is intended to do with
          trade flows. India, the UAE, Singapore and Australia are all close
          friends with the US, which could help finance some of this
          infrastructure. It’s the kind of thing the UAE might also contribute
          funds to, as part of its own renewables expansion and goals going into
          the COP28 climate conference it will be hosting next fall.

          Reliance Industries’ facility processes about 1.4% of all the oil
          produced in the world every day. Even here, the transition to
          renewable energy is gaining momentum.

          Few places capture the promising yet perilous state of the world’s
          energy transition better than where I visited earlier this week: The
          world’s largest oil refinery, situated in a once-empty desert along
          the Gulf of Kutch on the Arabian Sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here Reliance Industries Ltd. takes in 1.4 million barrels of crude
          each day from tanker ships offshore. The facility is a sprawling
          forest of pipes, tanks, boilers, generators and catalyzers, all
          landscaped very attractively with flower beds, greenery and ponds
          hosting geese and ducks and migratory birds.
        </p>
        <p>
          It operates 24-7-365, turning oil into the full array of fossil
          fuel-based products the world demands. These include everything from
          gasoline, diesel and jet fuel to the petrochemicals used in plastic
          packaging and clothing. The facility grew in three rounds of rapid
          development between the late 1990s and the mid-2000s, transforming
          Reliance into a global energy titan and its leader, Mukesh Ambani,
          into one of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful magnates.
        </p>
        <p>
          These days, in a previously unused corner of the complex, something
          else dramatic is getting underway. Another vast expanse of sandy soil
          has been flattened, just as the rest of the land once was. The
          foundations are being laid for the most ambitious integrated renewable
          energy project in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ambani, whose father founded Reliance and built it into an oil and gas
          giant, is building a huge solar panel factory here. That’s just for
          starters. This will be followed by a massive factory to produce
          batteries for storing renewable energy produced by the solar panels.
          Then will come another giant factory to make hydrogen electrolyzers, a
          carbon-free technology coming into view as a potential mainstay of the
          new energy age for making steel and fertilizers, as well as powering
          ships and perhaps someday even planes. Following the electrolyzer
          plant will come another factory that will manufacture fuel cells.
          These will deploy the hydrogen to power trucks and buses, perhaps
          cars. It’s an ambitious plan that starts with Reliance itself reaching
          net-zero carbon status by 2035 and builds from there to help India
          reach its national goals along the way to net zero by 2070. Ambani has
          vowed to pour $80 billion of investment into the project before the
          end of the decade, a scale and speed rivaling anything Reliance has
          done.
        </p>
        <p>
          No doubt he’s serious. The Jamnagar refinery rose with stunning speed,
          defying skeptics and inculcating a determined corporate culture. Text
          scrolling around and around a complex of massive flashing screens in
          Jamnagar’s control rooms display words ascribed to Ambani’s father,
          Reliance founder Dhirubhai Ambani: “For those who dare to dream, there
          are worlds to win.” Senior managers routinely, without a trace of
          irony, say things like, “The word ‘impossible’ doesn’t exist here.”
          This corporate promotional video about the construction of the
          Jamnagar complex gives you a sense of how the company, and many
          employees, view their mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Ambanis have also carefully aligned their ambitions with those of
          Prime Minister Narendra Modi, first during his stint as the chief
          minister of Gujarat and, since 2014, as he has solidified his position
          as India’s most significant leader since the country’s founding prime
          minister. The company’s success, flowing in no small part from its
          ability to secure regulatory approvals and maximize government
          policies to its advantage, has helped Modi as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ambani has used the overall combination to plunge into new industries.
          He upended India’s telecommunications and media industries between
          2016-2020, when I was living in India, with a new company called Jio.
          Moving at warp speed for a massive nationwide infrastructure project,
          Reliance Jio built a mobile phone network in just a few years that
          saturated cities and reached virtually every remote village. The
          company then used the network as a beachhead to push into media and
          retailing, challenging even Amazon in India.
        </p>
        <img

        <p>
          The Modi government is focused on energy, particularly renewable
          energy and hydrogen. So is Reliance. One of the top Jio executives
          from that time is now heading the company’s renewable energy efforts.
          The company is just one of several oil and gas heavyweights in India
          that are joining the renewables binge, some of whom I’ve written about
          earlier and others I have yet to get to.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is impossible to stand on the still quiet but soon-to-be-bustling
          new energy side of the Jamnagar complex, looking over at the hulking
          profile of the traditional refinery next door, and not think about the
          state of the global energy transition. Russia’s Ukraine invasion has
          shocked the world into a new awareness of how critical energy really
          is — and how precarious. When I covered the global energy beat for The
          Wall Street Journal, I used to say covering energy is a bit like
          covering air — few think about it until it’s in short supply — a
          lesson I first learned in New York’s citywide 2003 power outage and
          then, even more acutely, during visits to war-torn, and blackout
          plagued, Iraq after the U.S. invasion that year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where should we get our energy from, both now and in the future? The
          rapidly growing urgency of climate change tells us it must come from
          non-carbon sources, starting immediately. Soaring prices of oil, gas
          and coal tell us to hustle for more of any of those we can get into
          the system quickly to bring prices down.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the breach, different parts of the world are responding to these
          intensifying pressures differently — each region standing more or less
          where it sits. In the U.S., the world’s biggest oil and gas producer,
          a push is on to produce still more oil and gas. Europe — dependent on
          imports for 60% of its energy, a good deal of it from Russia — lurches
          between clinging even to Russian oil and gas while trying to square
          that with a realization now is the moment to decarbonize its energy
          sources. Middle East petro-states revel in the world’s sudden seeming
          desperation for fossil fuels only months after so many urged their
          rapid phase out at a global climate conference last year. India and
          China, both importing a greater share of their energy even than
          Europe, are grabbing any immediate sources of fossil fuel they can
          find, from Russian crude to domestic coal.
        </p>
        <p>
          As during the oil shocks of the 1970s, energy security is front of
          mind. The air is suddenly thin. The difference from a half century ago
          is that this time there are alternatives: solar, wind, hydrogen,
          increasingly cheap batteries and eventually fuel cells to knit it all
          together. Electric car sales doubled last year, and are expected to
          double again this year. Nuclear power appears on the cusp of a
          comeback, this time with smaller and safer reactors. Even cutting
          energy demand — the only option in the 1970s for reducing dependence
          on fossil fuels — is entering a new era where big data, computer
          algorithms, the connectivity of 5G networks and smart meters can
          squeeze out new efficiencies and benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are heat pumps! Good old fashioned turning down the thermostat
          in every gas-heated building in Europe by a single degree would save
          6% of the amount of gas the E.U. imported from Russia last year,
          according to the International Energy Agency. The outright leakage and
          deliberate wastage of total gas supplies going into Europe is equal to
          about one-fifth of all the Russian gas imported by the E.U., the
          agency says. Reducing those would not only create more marketable gas
          but also substantially reduce emissions of methane, an incredibly
          potent greenhouse gas most nations and companies have already vowed to
          stop emitting.
        </p>
        <p>
          The U.S. may ramp up some oil and gas production for now. Europe may
          delay some immediate decarbonization goals. Saudi Arabia may crow over
          a banner year for oil export revenues. China might burn more coal than
          ever this year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet China also led the world in solar power last year, adding an
          amount almost equal to the total power capacity of Spain. It might add
          another third more again this year, alongside world-beating
          installations of offshore wind turbines. Reliance’s Jamnagar refinery
          is still operating at maximum capacity. Yet next door, on a field very
          soon to be no longer flat and empty, the future of clean energy
          production is gathering force.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s not likely to be thwarted. Countries focused on energy security,
          fast-growing Asia especially but also in Europe, won’t build their
          future on imports of volatile energy supplies. Not when there are
          choices, as increasingly there are.

        <p>
          Renewables hold the promise to provide more than just energy for
          India. They can also create jobs and boost manufacturing prowess.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was clear during a visit I made to the ancient Arabian Sea port
          of Surat. The city was once the Mughal Empire’s main international
          port of call. It’s now one of the world’s fastest-growing cities.
          Surat has over the past half century turned itself into a global hub
          for diamond cutting, but at least one diamond fortune is now being
          funneled into solar panel manufacturing.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the biggest players in the diamond industry, Shri Ram Krishna
          Exports or SRK, was founded by Govind Dholakai. He arrived in Surat as
          a young man in 1964, found his way into the diamond cutting business
          and started the company with two friends. Now he’s a billionaire.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2008, amidst the global financial crisis, Mr. Dholakai looked to
          diversify the family business. His nephew, Ishver, recently returned
          from overseeing the company’s U.S. operations in New York City’s
          diamond district, suggested a move into the solar panel business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solar seemed like a business with a future, and panel manufacturing
          could draw on SRK’s reputation for precision, Ishver figured.
        </p>
        <p>“It’s in our bloodline,” he told me.</p>
        <p>
          After traveling to Germany, Japan and the U.S. to research the
          industry, Ishver launched Goldi Solar with seed funding from SRK in
          2011. Like a handful of other Indian solar manufacturers, Goldi
          decided not to compete at first with the Chinese in making solar cells
          themselves or the polysilicon wafers they were composed of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, Goldi bought solar cells from Chinese companies and assembled
          them into modules. This was a less technologically challenging, more
          labor-intensive task playing to India’s strengths, allowing the
          company to set up in a former denim jean factory near Surat. They even
          hired the factory manager to run their operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solar project developers snapped up these modules, arranging them into
          the massive arrays in the deserts of India’s northwest I visited.
        </p>
        <p>India’s solar sector accelerated dramatically.</p>
        <p>
          “It was getting cheaper and cheaper,” said Bharat Bhut, who co-founded
          Goldi and serves as a director. “The lower the price, the more the
          viability of solar power went up.”

          The problem remained, though: Like much of the world, India was
          spending huge sums to purchase solar panels from China. What earlier
          was a boon increasingly has felt like dependency on a country with
          which India has a raft of border disputes and fought a full blown war
          in 1962.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2020, a conflict erupted between Indian and Chinese troops at a
          flashpoint in the Himalayas. The clash left 20 Indian soldiers and an
          unknown number of Chinese combatants dead. In the aftermath, India has
          worked to reduce dependency on Chinese technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          That has meant imposing duties on imported solar equipment and a drive
          to build a domestic industry of its own. This has unleashed an
          avalanche of investment by Indian companies into solar panel
          manufacturing, including Goldi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Goldi is now building a panel manufacturing facility to feed its
          module assembly plant. More than a dozen other Indian companies are
          also starting up or dramatically boosting solar panel manufacturing,
          including the U.S. maker First Solar, which is building a panel
          factory in southern India. Under an agreement with the U.S., all of
          the India-based manufacturers will have unimpeded access to the U.S.
          market, giving them an edge against Chinese imports that are subject
          to U.S. anti-dumping tariffs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently proposed plans would have India producing enough panels and
          modules to meet domestic Indian demand by 2025 with some left over for
          export, according to one industry analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several of India’s biggest energy players are also looking into
          manufacturing the wafers that make up the cells, including even the
          state-controlled coal giant Coal India Ltd.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the tariffs will push up solar energy costs, already headed higher
          amid supply chain disruptions from Covid and the Ukraine war. Decades
          of decline, they have risen about 20 percent in the past year.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the recent World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Indian
          renewable energy developer ACME Group signed a memorandum of
          understanding worth $7 billion with the state government of Karnataka
          to develop an integrated solar to green hydrogen to green ammonia
          facility that will produce 1.2 million tonnes a year of green hydrogen
          by 2027. I visited ACME’s pilot green hydrogen facility in the ancient
          silk road city of Bikaner, at the moment the only working green
          hydrogen plant in India. It’s tiny, but proves the technology is
          viable. The question is how scalable is it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If these fronts develop along the lines renewables have — with the
          same plunging cost curves — India’s energy transition could gain
          momentum quickly past 2030.

            This week, the world’s top group of scientists examining climate
            change dropped a colossal compendium of the impacts that global
            warming is already having on the planet. The official summary of the
            report runs nearly 100 pages, with the full report weighing in at
            around ten times that. There’s a lot of climate impact already
            underway. The report meticulously, scientifically works its way
            through all of them, touching on nearly every corner of the earth.

          <i>
            But the key point isn’t that the damage is already occuring, or that
            it is already eye-openingly extensive. It’s that there is much we
            can do. We can, indeed must, immediately and drastically accelerate
            efforts to reduce the amount of global warming gasses we’re spewing
            into the atmosphere. We need to drive the balance of what we emit
            verses what we remove from the atmosphere to zero by mid-century. We
            can, indeed are already having to, adapt to a warmer world — one
            with the more intense storms, rising risk of fires, substantially
            higher temperatures and far more frequent droughts and floods. We
            must adapt — skillfully, cleverly and in a way that’s fair and just
            — not only to mitigate damage and maintain healthy societies for
            their own sake. We must do it in order to maintain the wherewithal
            to take on the greatest challenge humans have faced to date:
            transitioning our way of living from carbon intensive to carbon free
            at what amounts to warp speed.

            We’ve examined and analyzed many of these issues in this newsletter,
            focusing on India (here’s why). The journey now takes to India
            itself for the coming months. The global climate report this week —
            the second of three by the group — is as mammoth as the challenges

          This is the cattle barn at the Ram Ratna Vidya Mandir school in the
          district of Mira Bhayandar, along India’s Arabian seacoast. It’s an
          hour’s drive north of central Mumbai (once known as Bombay).
        </p>
        <p>
          The herd is owned and managed by a civil society group to provide milk
          and other dairy for a school and various community organizations the
          group runs. But for the past eight years, the cows have another job:
          helping create methane fuel to cook several thousand meals a day for
          the students and staff.
        </p>
        <p>
          On its own, the biogas project is tiny. Overseen by another, energy
          focused civil society group called Gram Oorja — which loosely
          translated means Energy for the Village — the facility turns cow dung
          into cooking gas. End products also include a manure slurry that’s
          used as fertilizer on nearby fields to grow mango, coconuts and other
          produce for the school. Presto, the byproduct of gas production is
          used to grow some of the food that’s ultimately cooked with the gas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Started by a trio of former bankers in the late 2000s, Gram Oorja has
          overseen 377 projects in 28 districts covering 100,000 Indians. These
          include solar powered irrigation pumps and small solar energy systems,
          known as microgrids, that provide electricity to villages located far
          off the public power grid. Funding generally comes from companies that
          either want to test concepts for new business lines or make
          philanthropic contributions under India’s corporate responsibility
          requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here’s why it matters in a bigger way, though: First off, while Gram
          Oorja’s project here is tiny, India’s cattle population is not. It’s
          the largest of any country, some 305 million cows and water buffalo as
          of 2021. There’s plenty of potential for projects like this to expand
          dramatically. Then there’s the recycling and re-use practiced at the
          Ram Ratna school project. They may seem like something out of a hippie
          commune, but here it’s mostly just practical. This mindset of
          recycling and re-use is working its way into new thinking about the
          global economy as the world bears down on the task of decarbonizing.
          It’s often referred to as the “circular economy.” But this is really
          just practical thinking for a new era that’s beginning in energy and
          agriculture, in India and beyond. This thinking is being taken up by
          some very big companies and industries, not just villages.
        </p>
        <p>
          These concepts are being scaled up — and will eventually have to
          continue scaling up exponentially, almost unimaginably — until they
          rival the scale of the fossil fuel-based production and consumption
          machine we understand as our economy.
        </p>
        <p>
          These include new ways to recycle innumerable megatons worth of the
          elements that go into batteries, which will be at the heart of both
          our transportation systems and our power grids. Effective re- and
          mult- use will be the key to solar power facilities that will produce
          drinking water from the sea and transform fresh water into hydrogen
          that can provide the heat to make “green” steel or propel airplanes.
          Even carbon removed from the atmosphere can be locked up by forging it
          into useful materials. The additional energy India will need to
          develop will increasingly need to come from renewable sources, small
          ones like the biogas facility here but also extremely large ones that
          apply some of the same principles.
        </p>
        <p>What’s perhaps the most important of those principles?</p>
        <p>
          Ask Bishan Das Agnihotri what the 70-year-old former Indian sailor,
          who has managed the Ramratna complex for 18 years, likes about the
          system and he doesn’t talk first about saving the planet. Before
          anything else, he cites cost savings.
        </p>
        <p>
          “High pressure gas is expensive,” he says of the tanks of Liquid
          Petroleum Gas, or LPG, that are his next best alternative.
        </p>
        <p>
          He figures the school saves about 2,000 rupees, or about $27 a day, by
          cutting the number of LPG cylinders they use each day by a little more
          than half, enough savings to feed dozens of students.
        </p>
        <p>“That’s very good,” he says, beaming.</p>
        <p>
          So while the biogas project here at Ram Ratna school is small, it’s
          worth understanding. And thinking about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sameer Nair, a Gram Oorja founder, gave us a tour of the project, and
          here’s now the system works:
        </p>
        <p>
          You’ve seen the cows. The 8,000 or so pounds of, shall we say,
          byproduct they produce each day is put into the gas-producing
          “digester” along with any human or cattle food leftovers. The
          leftovers are even better than the manure, though there’s a lot less
          of it. The undigested food will produce higher energy gas, since it
          hasn’t been, well, digested. That’s Rahul Karekar, the 36-year-old
          Gram Oorja employee who manages the group’s biogas projects, standing
          with it.

          Currently proposed plans would have India producing enough panels and
          modules to meet domestic Indian demand by 2025 with some left over for
          export, according to one industry analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several of India’s biggest energy players are also looking into
          manufacturing the wafers that make up the cells, including even the
          state-controlled coal giant Coal India Ltd.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the tariffs will push up solar energy costs, already headed higher
          amid supply chain disruptions from Covid and the Ukraine war. Decades
          of decline, they have risen about 20 percent in the past year.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the recent World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Indian
          renewable energy developer ACME Group signed a memorandum of
          understanding worth $7 billion with the state government of Karnataka
          to develop an integrated solar to green hydrogen to green ammonia
          facility that will produce 1.2 million tonnes a year of green hydrogen
          by 2027. I visited ACME’s pilot green hydrogen facility in the ancient
          silk road city of Bikaner, at the moment the only working green
          hydrogen plant in India. It’s tiny, but proves the technology is
          viable. The question is how scalable is it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If these fronts develop along the lines renewables have — with the
          same plunging cost curves — India’s energy transition could gain
          momentum quickly past 2030.

        <p>
          Among those who have lived in India, I doubt I’m alone in beginning to
          hanker for mangoes around this time of year.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s far too soon, of course. And I sincerely apologize to those
          trying to keep thoughts of this most delicious of all fruit at bay for
          voicing this yearning aloud so prematurely, but….in a few short
          months, they will arrive, luscious and ripe.
        </p>
        <p>If, that is, climate change doesn’t get in the way, again.</p>

        <p>
          A year ago as I made my way through India, a record spring heat wave
          enveloped the country. I wrote about it here. The spike in
          temperatures severely damaged India’s mango crop, cratering the income
          of many thousands of farmers in the country’s mango growing regions.
          Tens of millions of mango lovers were left without their favorite
          early summer treat, or paying ultra-premium prices for what survived.
        </p>
        <p>
          India is the world’s largest grower of mangoes, and has been for a
          very long time. Amir Khusrau, a renowned Mughal era Indo-Persian poet,
          called them “the fairest fruit of Hindustan.” The roughly 40% of the
          world crop India produces today includes over 1,000 varieties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Climate change has hit mango orchards in several ways. Sporadic rains
          now sometimes extend into December — well past the end of the
          traditional monsoon, a climate trend we looked at in my last post.
          That frequently delays the flowering of mango trees from the usual
          November and December until January, which pushes the ripening of the
          mangoes past March and into May and even June. Thus the harvest
          crosses into the ensuing year’s monsoon, which begins in June and
          causes fruit to rot before it attains maximum ripeness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last year, though, the big problem wasn’t late rains, but rather the
          early heat. Hot weather in March and April gives mango sun stroke.
          Development of the soft, sweet tissue we so love is retarded, the
          flesh of the mango left brown and mushy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Argh! Those who have peeled a seemingly luscious mango with
          anticipation only to discover this unpleasantness, you know exactly
          what I’m talking about.
        </p>
        <p>So disappointing!</p>
        <p>
          The travails of the mango are a reminder that even as climate change
          threatens existential damage in so many ways — to everything from
          parasites to whole countries and ecosystems, conceivably even our
          species one day — it also threatens right now many small things that
          make life worth living. We can survive without mangoes. But, as with
          so many things climate change is altering and will soon alter much
          more, the magnificent diversity and sheer pleasures of the planet are
          already shriveling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes we feel the impact more in the small things, like the
          sweetness of mango.

        <br></br>
        <p>
          Near the city of Ratnagiri, I visited with Vivek Bhide, a local
          physician and one of the area’s bigger mango farms owners. Bhide’s
          family has been in the business for generations. He worked hard
          helping to get the area formally recognized by the Indian government
          as the sole home of the sweetest, juiciest, melts-in-your-mouthiest
          mango variety. This would be the Alphonso, aka The King of Mango.
        </p>
        <p>
          The irony is that just when Bhide and other farmers of the area
          received the regional designation in 2018, weather conditions were
          seriously beginning to screw up the climatic sweet spot the region has
          enjoyed for cultivating these extra-special mangos.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Climate change is a major problem,” he told me as we sat in his
          receiving room for patients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the shifting rains, Bhide said insect and bacterial pest
          threats are changing with more frequent off-season rains and higher
          average temperatures and heat waves. Like the younger generations of
          tea growers we met in Darjeeling, mango farmers along the northern
          Konkan coast are moving towards sustainable, organic farming
          techniques to try to make their crop more resilient in the face of new
          conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I won’t belabor the disaster that was last year’s mango crop. This was
          covered very ably here by The New York Times, and my former colleague
          at The Wall Street Journal, Shan Li, did a wonderful podcast episode
          on the anguish of a mango farmer in the state of Uttar Pradesh. NPR’s
          Diaa Hadid reported on the same crisis in Pakistan to the north of
          India.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ll likely be back close to India this mango harvest season, in the
          United Arab Emirates, which is well within importing range. So here’s
          to hoping this year’s crop comes through.

          On a balmy day last June, I drove along the lush coastline of the
          state of Goa to learn about some of the coldest places on earth —
          though all of them are warming quickly.
        </p>

        <p>
          The earth’s north and south poles are far from the Indian
          subcontinent. The so-called Third Pole, the heights of the Himalayas,
          lies partly within India. This trio of extremities play critical roles
          determining global weather patterns that are of existential importance
          to India. The most prominent of these is the South Asian monsoon, the
          annual winds that bring the subcontinent life-giving rain.
        </p>
        <p>
          India has steadily ramped up efforts to study these far-flung regions.
          Distant as they are from the bulk of India’s 1.4 billion people, they
          are warning much faster than the rest of the earth. This is almost
          certain to wreak havoc on weather patterns that have defined life from
          the Gangetic plain in India’s north to its coasts in the south.

          India’s research efforts are based in Goa at the National Center for
          Polar and Ocean Research, or NCPOR. The institute oversees India’s two
          research bases in Antarctica and one in the Arctic, as well as a more
          recently opened research station in the Indian Himalayas.

        <br></br>
        <p>
          My interest in the center began several months earlier, during a talk
          with Anoop Mahajan, a researcher with the Indian Institute of Tropical
          Meteorology. He has joined several of NCPOR’s polar missions. Mahajan
          studies the unique chemistry that occurs when air and seawater mix
          under extreme polar conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We’re trying to understand how these remote places are changing,
          because so often it comes back to what’s happening with humans,” he
          told me. “There are lots of different types of connections, especially
          with the atmosphere and oceans, that can impact things like the
          monsoon.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Tropical Goa may feel far away from poles, but the weather patterns of
          the Indian subcontinent are part of a truly global system of air and
          water, constantly in motion. India’s monsoon winds begin in June as
          the sun warms the subcontinental landmass faster than the expanse of
          sea to the south and west. The warm overland air rises, sucking in
          below it moisture-laden air from over the sea. This generates the
          winds and steady rains that characterize the first half of the
          monsoon. The rains begin in Kerala in the southwest of the country.
          How much water the summer monsoon carries partly depends on a global
          phenomenon that takes place in the oceans surrounding the Antarctic,
          the El Niño. Also known as the Southern Oscillation, this is where a
          huge mass of relatively warmer water moves back and forth across the
          waters in the southern part of the globe in years-long, even
          decades-long, cycles. These correlate with weather patterns stretching
          from Bali to California. The monsoon’s behavior in the northern plains
          of India is also influenced by the northern Jet Stream, a high-speed
          flow of air around the upper northern hemisphere whose path is
          determined in part by temperatures in the Arctic. The monsoon reverses
          in September as the sun’s intensity lessens in the northern hemisphere
          and the land, particularly in the Himalayan heights, cools more
          quickly than seas surrounding the subcontinent. Roughly eight months
          ensue with far less rain, or none at at. The monsoon brings 80% of all
          annual rainfall between June and September.
        </p>
        <p>
          This seasonal back-and-forth has shaped the structure and rhythm of
          life on an almost wholly agrarian subcontinent for millennia. Until
          the fossil fuel age, the monsoon winds even determined commercial
          patterns across South and Southeast Asia. Goods-laden ships from
          Africa, the Middle East and Europe sailed the trade winds east when
          the monsoon began and rode them back when it reversed. Even small
          variations in the monsoon can disrupt much in India, which still has a
          largely agricultural economy dependent on predictable seasonal
          rainfall.

          How climate change will affect the Indian monsoon is thus a matter of
          considerable scientific study. Climate models predict that warmer
          temperatures should intensify the monsoon, bringing more rain and
          stronger winds to India. So far, though, that’s not exactly what’s
          happened, due to another problem created by industrialization: air
          pollution. Average monsoon rains actually weakened through the latter
          half of the 20th century as India developed one of the worst air
          pollution problems in the world. Since the turn of the century,
          monsoon rains have rebounded, even as air pollution has worsened. Fine
          particulate matter — created by everything from crop burning to urban
          construction and coal power generation — blocks sunlight, keeping a
          lid on atmospheric warming.
        </p>
        <p>
          It remains to be determined whether all this means that rising
          pollution dampened the impact of climate change before that effect was
          outpaced more recently by accelerated warming. But climate researchers
          continue to predict more intense monsoons as warming further picks up
          pace in the coming decades.
        </p>
        <p>
          One twist does seem clear: rain and snowfall have become significantly
          more variable in recent years. Precipitation, more often than before,
          comes in short, sometimes incredibly intense bursts, often well
          outside the usual monsoon season. These can be incredibly destructive.
          They quickly overwhelm existing drainage and the ability of land to
          absorb the water into underground aquifers. From the northern Ladakh
          plateau to the southern city of Chennai and across to rural Kerala,
          residents showed me cell phone videos of the powerful flooding these
          have caused in recent years. Pakistan experienced an epochal “rain
          bomb” event like this last year, leaving one-third of the country
          under water. The U.S. state of California is experiencing another —a
          so-called “atmospheric river” of wet air — right now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Researchers at Goa’s polar research center are how climate change is
          influencing polar weather, how those changes in the weather are
          influencing biology and chemistry of the Southern Ocean, and how those
          changes are radiating out to impact India and the world. During their
          polar expeditions these scientists gather data by drilling into ice
          sheets, dropping robots into the sea, trawling for sea water samples
          and even strapping sensors onto seals. Some of the devices transmit
          data through the polar winter all the way to Goa by satellite link.
          Their work, coordinated with similar teams from many other countries,
          underscores how deeply enmeshed we all are in an intricate, truly
          global system that is readjusting in hard-to-predict ways to rising
          temperatures and higher levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
          gasses.
        </p>
        <p>
          To give just one example, Thamban Meloth, the first staff scientist to
          join the research institute when it was set up in 2002, leads a team
          studying ice in Antarctica. Among their tasks is building a collection
          of core samples where they drill down and preserve a vertical
          cross-section of ice accumulated over tens of thousands of years. In a
          lab, this can be read like a history.
        </p>
        <p>
          How has the ice built and thinned over those millenia? What can be
          gleaned about the role of greenhouse gasses in those previous periods
          of warming and cooling? Scientists have long known that the oceans of
          the world have absorbed the majority of the carbon dioxide human
          activity has unleashed, thus moderating the warming that results when
          the gas stays in the atmosphere. Much of this absorption occurs in the
          cold waters of the southern ocean as they are churned by winds,
          temperature variations in temperature, salinity and chemical
          composition — all influenced by warming temperatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          “How long will this carbon sink be here?” asks Meloth. “Nobody has
          that kind of long term data yet.”

        <h1>Coal Conundrum, Goan Style</h1>
        <span>
          Coal is the beating heart of India’s energy system. Few know this
          better than the residents of Goa, many of whom have had enough.

        <p>
          Most of our journey so far has been about the fallout from climate
          change and India’s renewable energy boom. But let’s not forget: coal
          remains the life-blood of India’s economy, despite being one of the
          country’s worst environmental scourges.
        </p>

        <p>
          It courses through the subcontinent on railway cars and trucks,
          distributing black dust into the air, broken coal rubble along the way
          and ultimately carbon into the atmosphere when it is combusted to
          create heat and electricity. Domestic coal supplies are pulled from
          mines in the country’s east, deeply scarring the mined areas and
          communities there. Imported coal arrives on ships from Indonesia,
          Australia and South Africa, where similar environmental and community
          damage is inflicted, often by subsidiaries of Indian industrial
          conglomerates operating there. Coal is fuel for three-quarters of
          India’s total electricity generation. It generates all the heat used
          to make steel and cement. All these processes spew particulates and
          create huge accumulations of residual ash that add to India’s
          worst-in-the-world air pollution and widespread environmental
          degradation.
        </p>
        <p>
          India is among the world’s most coal-dependent countries, relying on
          the dirtiest of all fossil fuels to meet fully 40% of its total energy
          demand, a share that’s risen over the past few decades, according to
          the International Energy Agency.
        </p>

        <p>
          Few know all of this better than the residents of Goa. Though one of
          India’s smallest states, Goa’s gorgeous beaches and lush forests have
          made it a destination for everyone from 16th century Portuguese
          explorers to 1970s hippies. Into this coastline, which includes some
          of India’s largest sea-turtle nesting areas, is carved one of India’s
          biggest ports for off-loading coal from Australia and Indonesia. It is
          then carried on by rail through several seaside communities and across
          one of most biodiverse habitats in the world to steel mills further
          inland. Railway cars carry the rolled steel sheets back to the coast
          for transport around India and overseas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the Indian government wants to vastly expand the port, put in
          another rail track parallel to the existing one and run a new
          electrical power line across the area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Orville Rodrigues is part of a citizens protest movement opposing the
          port expansion and trying to stop the doubling of the tracks, which
          requires a dramatic widening of the rail corridor through the center
          of a biodiversity reserve. Unlike the Konkan Railway, which parallels
          the coast and was the subject of my last post, this rail line is
          exclusively for freight. The first track already cuts through the
          mountain range known as the Western Ghats to reach the inland Deccan
          plateau in the state of Karnataka, home of huge steel mills owned by
          some in India’s richest and most powerful families. The port is
          operated by Gautam Adani, who has become Asia’s richest man since I
          wrote about him in this post a few years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          The movement, which has hamstrung the projects with marches and
          demonstrations, underscores the price India pays for its use of coal.
          Later in the journey we’ll look at the reverse: the cost to mining
          communities will pay when India begins moving away from coal. That day
          remains both inevitable and largely unplanned for. Such is the nature
          of dependence: destructive to continue, difficult to stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          This chart (below) shows countries ranked by their various
          dependencies on coal, from the projected longevity of their steel and
          coal-fired power plants (“Lock-in”) to the share of coal in
          electricity generation (“Energy dependence”). “Development gap”
          represents the amount of economic growth per person needed to catch up
          with global averages — a gap likely to be addressed using their
          current, coal-based system. “Economic dependence” is the share of coal
          in total exports. As you can see, India exports very little coal, but
          its relatively young fleet of coal-fired power plants threatens to
          lock it into coal for longer as it struggles to meet energy demand
          that is expected to more than double over the next few decades.

          Goa was a Portuguese colony from 1510 all the way to 1961, when the
          Indian government forcibly annexed the enclave a little over a dozen
          years after India threw off the British empire. Rodrigues hails from
          one of the many communities along the Arabian Sea coast that adopted
          Catholicism and developed a distinctly Goan Portuguese identity.

          claims the foundations date back even before explorer Vasco da Gama’s
          travels brought him to India in 1498. Today it retains the colonial
          era decor.

          Rodrigues also showed me damage that the continuous rail trafficking
          of coal has caused the community. Despite plastic covers over the
          freight cars, coal dust from the jostling loads permeates the air and
          leaves a black film on foliage far from the tracks. Larger chunks of
          coal fall off and litter the sides of the railway bed. Many of the
          homes of residents are just a few feet from the tracks, which were cut
          and laid through land that was forcibly taken with only modest
          compensation. A doubling of the tracks would require the abandonment
          of many of the homes. These communities suffer elevated levels of
          respiratory disease, especially among children.
        </p>
        <p>
          Residents and environmental activists also say the railway would
          severely damage the biodiversity reserve further inland with similar
          particulate pollution. It would also further bifurcate what was once a
          single, unimpeded natural habitat on both sides of the tracks. And the
          government is seeking to loosen regulations to permit more building
          and development, including piers, hotels and cruise ship berths,
          within a 500-meter band along the shoreline where all development is
          now prohibited.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more they protest and resist, though, the more they’re accused by
          the government of selfishly standing in the way of national
          development, Rodrigues says.
        </p>
        <p>
          “They tell the whole of India that we’re against the nation,” he says.

        <p>
          The protests in Goa began in April of 2020, just a few weeks after
          India’s leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, ordered one of the
          strictest national lockdowns in the world as Covid-19 cases began to
          appear in India.
        </p>

        <p>
          The demonstrations were in response to India’s environmental ministry
          approving, in a video conference meeting, three large infrastructure
          projects — a second railroad track from the port, a four-lane doubling
          of a freeway and a second electrical transmission line alongside an
          existing one. All three projects cut through a major wildlife preserve
          in the Western Ghats mountain range, itself a United Nation’s World
          Heritage Site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the lockdown, a dynamic campaign against the projects gained
          momentum. Protestors blocked train tracks, with many eventually being
          arrested, including a well-known soccer star who got involved. The
          movement eventually was dubbed the Save Mollem campaign — on social
          media #SaveMollem — after the biodiversity reserve the trio of
          projects threatened. Youth leaders, who ran the gamut from naturalists
          to graphic designers, deployed art and music to great effect and drew
          national headlines. Well over 10,000 mask-wearing demonstrators turned
          out for some of the demonstrations, despite the Covid threat and in
          defiance of government restrictions on gatherings. The local Catholic
          church even provided support for the movement.
        </p>

          You can see some of the art works here. And this article has some
          terrific photos of the region’s natural beauty and unique collection
          of wildlife. Disha Shetty, one of India’s leading journalists covering
          environmental, climate and human rights issues, produced this series
          of stories on the movement with support from the Washington DC-based
          Pulitzer Center.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spent a morning in Goa meeting with Sarita Fernandez, a coastal
          policy expert who has worked to protect the state’s Ridley Sea Turtle
          population and participated in the Save Mollem movement. She says the
          government likely didn’t realize what it was up against in Goa, a
          state with some of India’s highest levels of education and
          environmental awareness and a long history of defying the powers that
          be.
        </p>
        <p>“Goans can get really rebellious and they did,” she told me.</p>
        <p>
          So far, lawsuits filed by the movement have succeeded in halting or
          altering the projects on orders of the country’s special environmental
          courts. The government was told to drop the second electricity
          transmission line and string a new, higher capacity line on higher
          stanchions above the tree canopy in the forest to avoid having to cut
          through it. The road widening and railway track doubling were also
          rejected by the court for flaws in the environmental review, although
          the panel said the government could restart the project if a new
          environmental review showed a way to go forward without harming the
          natural surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Activists say that’s unrealistic, but the government hasn’t given up
          on the projects.

          What happens when a railway built for climate stress gets stressed
          further?
        </p>

        <p>
          Earlier in our journey we saw how climate change is affecting India’s
          natural landscapes, such as the Sundarbans wetlands. We looked at the
          impact on agriculture in the tea fields of Darjeeling. Climate change
          will also take a huge toll on infrastructure, including the Indian
          railway — even, or perhaps especially, on infrastructure built to
          withstand environmental stress.
        </p>
        <p>
          To my suprise, I found Indian railways officials largely unconcerned
          and mostly unresponsive to my queries about how climate change will
          affect the railway. Most of those I asked gave puzzled looks or
          launched into explanations of how the railway was rapidly electrifying
          its operations. The electrification of the railway is, indeed,
          impressive (if only half the solution, since nearly two-thirds of
          India’s electricity comes from burning coal).
        </p>

        <p>
          But I was interested in more than how the railway is doing its part by
          cutting its carbon footprint. I also wanted to know how the railway —
          among the world’s largest pieces of infrastructure — will deal with
          the fallout from climate change: rising sea levels, stronger storms,
          more intense rains, and heat waves.

        <p>
          India is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change, which
          means equal risk for a railway that operates in every corner of the
          subcontinent and touches the lives of virtually every Indian. The
          railway employs some 1.5 million Indians, many of them working
          outdoors or in unairconditioned spaces. It transports over 20 million
          riders daily, most traveling in carriages without air conditioning.
          Surely lethal heat waves like the one India experienced when I was
          there would be top of mind. So, too, higher winds and more intense
          rain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Somewhere within the sprawling railway bureaucracy someone must be
          contemplating how climate change will impact it. But I couldn’t find
          them. Instead, what I encountered were officials — virtually none of
          whom willing to talk on the record — trying day-to-day to keep up with
          climate challenges they’ve long confronted but increasingly worry
          could get much worse over time.

          No place was that more evident than on the stunning stretch of track
          known as the Konkan Railway, which cuts a breathtakingly scenic path
          down the country’s Arabian Sea coastline along a mountain range known
          as the Western Ghats. This is a railway like no other in the world,
          with lush peaks to one side and blue seas on the other as it runs
          through the three states of Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka.
        </p>

        <p>
          Completed in 1998, the Konkan railway took just six years to build
          despite India’s one-time British colonial masters having dismissed a
          rail path through such challenging terrain as “not feasible.” The
          accomplishment was thus all the more gratifying for post-colonial
          India, and turned the man who honchoed the initiative — railway
          higher-up E. Sreedharan — into a legend. Sreedharan went on to build
          Delhi’s first-rate subway as an encore.

        <br></br>
        <p>
          The 472 miles of Konkan rail line required more than 2,000 bridges and
          93 tunnels, as well as sign-off (sometimes controversially) from some
          42,000 landowners. Nine of the tunnels exceeded two kilometers, which
          was pretty much the longest previously built on the Indian railway.
          The longest of the Konkan tunnels was triple that.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the challenges didn’t end with its completion. The Konkan Railway,
          which operates through some of India’s heaviest monsoon rains,
          suffered some horrible accidents during its first decade. A locomotive
          collided with a boulder that fell on the track in 2003 during heavy
          rain, leaving 51 passengers dead. The next year a landslide also
          deposited boulders on the tracks, causing the train that hit them to
          plunge into a ravine. Sixteen passengers died and 100 were injured.

        <p>
          Thousands of other landslides over the years have cost the railway
          months of lost operational time and millions in repairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the managers of the Konkan Railway are hardly unfamiliar with
          environmental and weather challenges. Indeed, these are hardwired into
          the history and ongoing operations of the railway, literally defining
          its identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet climate change will bring new challenges, not so much in type as
          in intensity, according to a 2013 study by researchers at the Indian
          Institute of Management in Ahmedabad. These challenges will manifest
          in two ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first will be a steady step-up in the average temperature, with
          the resulting impact on weather distributed more or less evenly. Say,
          a half-degree warmer daily temperature average over the next decade
          yielding a quarter-inch more rain, but falling with roughly the same
          regularity across the monsoons over the next decade.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second manifestation is more variability, with more torrential
          downpours interspersed with longer dry spells.
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64fe2ee8-039d-43ec-b1e8-5a905d674979_4032x3024.jpeg"
          alt="bill spindle"
        ></img>

        <br></br>
        <p>
          For now, that first manifestation is fairly benign, since the
          engineers who built the Konkan Railway included buffers to deal with
          the occasional deviation from the average. As long as weather
          deviations don’t exceed those buffers, the existing infrastructure and
          operations to maintain continue to perform. On the other hand, if
          those buffers — which, remember, were built with past weather patterns
          not future climate changes in mind — are eventually exceeded by new
          day-to-day weather parameters, well, then the railway is in serious
          trouble.
        </p>
        <p>
          Residents and environmental activists also say the railway would
          severely damage the biodiversity reserve further inland with similar
          particulate pollution. It would also further bifurcate what was once a
          single, unimpeded natural habitat on both sides of the tracks. And the
          government is seeking to loosen regulations to permit more building
          and development, including piers, hotels and cruise ship berths,
          within a 500-meter band along the shoreline where all development is
          now prohibited.
        </p>

        <br></br>

        <p>
          But the big worry is that the second scenario gets the upper hand, and
          weather extremes become, well, even more extreme. The evidence so far
          is this is what’s happening. The usual evenly distributed rains of the
          monsoon are more often bursting forth in the torrential downpours that
          loosen boulders and trigger landslides.
        </p>

        <p>
          So far, railway officials are managing the challenges much as they
          have since the ugly accidents of 2003-2004: by building stepped
          grading along particularly vulnerable stretches of track, adding metal
          netting to hold the slopes and bolts to secure rock in place. They’re
          experimenting with automated landslide detectors, and have stepped up
          monitoring of the track, with local villagers deputized to walk every
          kilometer of track twice daily to report any signs of loose rock on or
          near the track.
        </p>

        <br></br>
        <p>
          Drivers have also been given more discretion to slow their locomotives
          during heavy downpours without regard to schedule disruptions, two
          railway officials told me.
        </p>
        <p>
          All those measures may not be enough, as the study notes that one of
          the bigger factors holding rock in place is total forest cover in the
          areas nearby the track but beyond the railway’s control. Those areas
          are undergoing ever more intense development pressures, which almost
          invariably bring deforestation with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, the Konkan railway is holding out. There haven’t been any
          major accidents in recent years, after the railway management stepped
          up its efforts in the wake of the two accidents after the millenium
          turn. The two officials who spoke to me said they took comfort in the
          railway’s practice of building infrastructure to last 200 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem is that’s 200 years based on past weather patterns, and
          the next two centuries aren’t likely to look like the last two.

          <i>
            Before today’s post, I want to note we’re now in the backstretch of
            our India climate and energy journey. We’ve reached the city of
            Bengaluru after riding the rails from Kolkata across India’s north
            to Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat and then down the Arabian Sea coast
            as far as Mangalore. Today we visit the Deccan plains as we travel
            to the Bay of Bengal. There we’ll stop at the abandoned city of
            Rameshwaram, victim of a climate event more than a half century ago,
            before turning north to Chennai, the state of Orissa and back to
            Kolkata. Then there’s a last bonus leg of the journey, up into the
            Himalayas with a surprise stop where our adventure ends, or at least
            THIS adventure ends. There’s still a lot more to come. For those who
            joined along the way, you can find posts from all my previous stops
            in the archives of this blog.

          Technologies transition. The tools we use evolve. Or we evolve them,
          if I can put it that way. Stone to iron, which gets replaced by
          bronze; clay is exchanged for paper, which gets displaced by liquid
          crystal displays; horses pull carts, which become cars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Happens in energy, too: fire to photons to…well, we really don’t know
          yet. Maybe nuclear fusion someday, a veritable sun in our pocket.
        </p>

        <p>
          Perhaps oddly, we respond emotionally as these technologies come and
          go. We fear them until we miss them. Fire inhabits our nightmares as
          we harness it to realize our dreams.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 1955 film Pather Panchali, by legendary Bengali director Satyajit
          Ray, captures this ambivalence in its opening scene. It is the dawn of
          the modern age in early 20th century Bengal. Teenage Durga and her
          little brother Apu stand under a matrix of foreign, buzzing electrical
          transmission lines. They walk into a field of tall grass and wait —
          for the whistle of the train.
        </p>

        </span>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          When they hear it, Apu races towards it. The locomotive cuts a path
          across the screen, its thick, black smoke filling the sky. From the
          other side of the tracks, through the speeding rail carraiges, we see
          Apu stand in awe as the mechanical beast speeds towards the big city,
          his future. But we also know this scene takes place in retrospect.
          There’s a powerful sense of the director, our storyteller, looking
          back from that future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, we tame these technologies. We learn to leverage and live
          with them, and then we consign them to history. We wrangle our
          trepidation into affection, and then we package it up into nostalgia.
          It’s a necessary process, like grieving, that helps us move on to
          confront and conquer the next new technology. That’s what Satyajit Ray
          is doing with the Apu trilogy, a coming of age tale in which this
          movie is part one.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve thought a lot about this since visiting T.R. Raghunandan, a
          retired elite Indian bureaucrat who spends much of his time fashioning
          exact scale models of historic steam locomotives out of elephant dung
          paper. Yes, that would be paper made from pachyderm poop. Raghunandan
          swears it’s uniquely suited for his purposes, soft and malleable yet
          durable.

          We often think of energy transitions as purely technical undertakings.
          But as I explain in this earlier post, the most obvious challenges
          right now are less scientific than political and economic — the mire
          of vested interests, greenwashing and outdated business models. There
          are emotional and psychological impediments — fears, really, of
          change, of the unknown, of the daunting challenges ahead — holding us
          back, too. These hurdles are underappreciated, I believe, and more
          attention to clearing them away would help us through the thicket of
          our mid-transition malaise.

          India’s railway moved from the last steam locomotive to fully electric
          ones in less than a generation. This happened so quickly partly
          because India was playing catch up. The newer technologies, first
          diesel then electric locomotives, already existed elsewhere and India
          subbed them. But this also involved a lot of cultural and social
          adjustment, first and foremost for the men who drove and kept up the
          steam locos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ceremonies were held to commemorate the retirement of these machines,
          and almost invariably them men who worked them. “Black Beauty
          Contests” marked their twilight years, drawing crowds and media
          coverage. It was the end of an era.
        </p>
        <p>
          Raghunandan feels that same nostalgia. He grew up in Kerala in a
          family historically consigned to the lowest rank of Indian society.
          The were Dalits, once known as “untouchables.” His mother nonetheless
          became a medical doctor. She was 101 years old and lived nearby on her
          own when I visited Rhaghunandan last year,
        </p>
        <p>
          Raghunandan studied at one of the country’s top universities and
          landed in India’s elite civil service. He worked on local governance
          issues and eventually retired, becoming an international consultant to
          encourage emerging democracies from Mongolia and East Timor. He had a
          moment of international acclaim when he started a website, I Paid a
          Bribe, which encouraged regular citizens to admit each time they paid
          a bribe, explain the circumstances and how they felt. It was a way of
          fighting, through empowerment by cathartic exposure, an endemic
          problem that hamstrings India’s economy and leaves many Indians
          ashamed and dispirited.

          By folding, rolling and punching holes in Elephant poop paper,
          Raghunandan has continued the process of packing an era off to an
          emotionally manageable past so we can appreciate it, learn from it,
          and move on, confident in that knowledge.

          “For me, trains and railway locomotives are all part of the romance of
          visiting my village,” he told me as we sat in the garden of a
          once-rural home now in a suburb of the city of Bengaluru. “My
          grandmother would tell stories at night and you would always hear this
          ghostly hoot of steam engines. And every time we would hear that we
          would run out and stand at the gate from where you could see the train
          200 or 300 meters away. You would wave at the train. It’s one of the
          enduring memories of my childhood. We always had such affection for
          the train. It made all this fuss when it went by. So busy, with all
          those levers working. It sets off something in your mind.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Today his models are fantastically detailed, miniature reincarnations
          of actual historic locomotives right down to the number and placement
          of faux rivets.
        </p>
        <p>Raghunandan sees these machines as the culmination of an era.</p>
        <p>
          “Not a single electronic device in them,” he said. “The whole thing is
          mechanical. And if you break it down, all based on principles you
          learned in the sixth grade. Electricity was a paradigm shift, when
          you’re dealing with a motive force, an energy you cannot see. Here you
          can see the water being converted into steam by the heat, you can
          sense the pressure the steam creates. From there it’s about levers and
          gears and wheels and springs. This is caveman logic carried to its
          final pinnacle of evolution.”

          On a peninsula jutting towards Sri Lanka, one confronts India’s

          The spit of land extending from the state of Tamil Nadu towards the
          teardrop-shaped island of Sri Lanka is a quintessentially Indian
          amalgam of legend, myth and history.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is place where, in the epic Ramayana, one of the two great tales in
          the Sanskrit-Hindu literary tradition, the hero Ram points with his
          mighty bow. This marks the spot for Hanuman, his monkey god ally, to
          muster his simian troops and build a bridge across the windswept
          channel to Lanka. The exiled future king Ram crosses to confront his
          nemesis, Ravana, in a climactic battle to rescue Sita, his virtuous
          wife, from her garden prison there.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tongue of land is also the scene of the tragedy of Dhanushkodi, a
          real-life village swept away by a huge cyclone in 1964. Accounts of
          the fateful day invariably feature the determined, if naive, railway
          engineer who drove his locomotive into the gale. The train was
          engulfed by the storm surge, leaving him and all of the 115 passengers
          aboard dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, finally, the city of Rameshwaram — which means “Lord of Ram” in
          Sanskrit, a reference to the Hindu deity Shiva — is the hometown of
          one of the most celebrated of India’s modern heros (outside of
          Bollywood and Cricket).

          A.P. J. Abdul Kalam was born here in 1931, to a poor Muslim family. He
          became a scientist known as the “Missile Man of India,” for developing
          the ballistic missiles that can carry India’s most powerful weapons.
          He was a key figure overseeing the country’s historic nuclear tests in
          1998, working closely with the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata
          Party, which led the government at the time, as it does now. Abdul
          Kalam ultimately became India’s 11th president, with support not only
          from the BJP but also the opposition Congress Party. He died at age
          eighty four in the northeast of the country while delivering a lecture
          titled, “Creating a Liveable Planet Earth.”

          The jagged layering in these three distinct stories — real, imagined
          and mythologized, jostled together by the tremors of time and the
          human psyche — makes Rameshwaram as good a place as any to contemplate
          the promise and peril of India’s trajectory today. That includes its
          role contributing to climate change and its response to the
          devastating impact changes in the climate will have on the
          subcontinent itself.

          My visit here was a meander through these intermingled realms. In the
          company of a local guide, a 30-minute drive took us to the easternmost
          point on the peninsula, where even on a calm day one can easily
          imagine being consumed by the surrounding turbulent sea. The Bay of
          Bengal is visible to the left, through the Palk Straits. The Indian
          Ocean is to the right, via the Gulf of Mannar. We have now crossed
          from India’s west coast (which I wrote about here, here, here and
          here) to its eastern shores. From here our travels will turn back
          north to where we began.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, we tame these technologies. We learn to leverage and live
          with them, and then we consign them to history. We wrangle our
          trepidation into affection, and then we package it up into nostalgia.
          It’s a necessary process, like grieving, that helps us move on to
          confront and conquer the next new technology. That’s what Satyajit Ray
          is doing with the Apu trilogy, a coming of age tale in which this
          movie is part one.

        <p>
          The cul de sac at this extreme tip of land is just a few dozen miles
          from Sri Lanka and used solely by tourists and pilgrims. They walk
          beach — marked by signs warning of currents too strong for safe
          swimming — and stare out across a submerged land bridge of limestone
          shoals that once existed and is now visible only from the sky above.
          Today Indians park, mill and take selfies in the place where Hanuman
          and his troops supposedly began their work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Driving back, we stopped at the ruins of Dhanushkodi. Its derelict
          buildings — a former post office, an abandoned train station, a
          crumbling church and dozens of broken down homes along the beach — are
          inhabited by a few fishermen and roadside sellers of Ramayana merch
          and snacks for pilgrims.

          The town, once home to thousands of families, was abandoned by the
          state and central government after the 1964 cyclone. It was judged not
          worth the effort to rebuild the rail line and extend water and
          electricity services to the village, likely again to be overwhelmed by
          one of the many cyclones that strike the coast each year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Driving back along the road, with waves crashing up against both sides
          of the peninsula, it was indeed easy to imagine the waters rising to
          swallow the causeway.
        </p>
        <p>
          We stopped at several sacred sites where devotees believe more events
          from the Ramayana took place. Each is a kind of touchpoint, a Tirtha
          or “crossing point” in Sanskrit, where the world we experience in
          daily life meets a sacred realm overlaid upon it. These exist
          throughout India, forming a sacred landscape, or map, described
          brilliantly by the academic Diana Eck in her book, India: A Sacred
          Geography.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the tens of millions of Hindu devotees who trod paths to these
          myth-laden locales in pilgrimages throughout the year, the events and
          the stories they tell are in a way more real than “reality.” This was
          most apparent in the Rameshwaram Temple. I walked among thousands of
          pilgrims doing the rounds to various fountains and tanks throughout
          its sprawling grounds, dousing themselves in the holy water or having
          it thrown upon them.

          Later we visited the home where Abdul Kalam was born, as well as the
          memorial building where he is buried. Both were infused with the
          hagiography that slowly enshrouded the bright young scientist as he
          morphed into a silver-haired quasi-guru who, despite being Muslim, has
          come to embody the Bharatiya Janata Party’s hard-edged Hindu
          nationalist vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abdul Kalam read Sanskrit and adhered to a vegetarian diet. He stood
          up for — and his legacy has been further shaped to personify — India’s
          aspirations to lift itself to a prominent position in the world
          through scientific and technological prowess. Controversy erupted when
          his memorial was constructed with a carved copy of the Bhagavad Gita,
          a seminal Sanskrit work, prominently displayed and members of Abdul
          Kalam’s family sought also to include a copy of the Koran and Bible to
          underscore a more eclectic side of Abdul Kalam. Hindu activists were
          having none of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          What does all of this have to do with climate and energy? Maybe only
          this: As the world slides into the grip of conflicts and
          confrontations — Europe-Ukraine-Russia, China-U.S. — climate concerns
          are taking a back seat to security.

          India has, largely, tried to steer clear of these, essentially trying
          to keep its head down. But India becomes the most populous country in
          the world this year, surpassing China’s 1.4 billion people. The
          nation, and especially its Hindu Nationalist leader Prime Minister
          Narendra Modi, increasingly seek an appropriate “leading role” on the
          world stage. One manifestation of that is India’s leadership of the
          “Group of 20” prominent nation’s this year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rameshwaram illuminates two paths the country, with its rich human
          history and unique yet also universal religious traditions, must
          choose between. One is a solipsistic vision of Hindu chauvinism that
          sees the energy transition as one more nationalist project bolstering
          India’s strength relative to others, pursued to the extent, and only
          the extent, it accomplishes that. Another is a truer leadership path
          that blends national pride with the country’s formidable scientific
          prowess and a truly expansive version of the theme India has chosen
          for its G20 year — Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, “One Earth, One Family, One
          Future.” To be genuine, this vision would have to begin at home and
          extend outward beyond its borders.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I worry India is veering towards the former vision, mainly because
          the BJP can’t seem to stomach the family part at home. It’s not too
          late for a course correction. The fate of the world, like that of the
          train in Danushkodi, hangs in the balance.

          Indian leaders have long touted the energy security provided by coal
          as the country’s only abundant domestic fuel source. But two groups of
          Indians, especially, pay a price for this ‘security’: the young and
          the vulnerable, especially those living where coal is extracted or
          burned.
        </p>
        <p>
          India’s youth, like young people everywhere, are seeing their future
          stolen from them as greenhouse gas emissions mount, while the poor
          suffer disproportionately under the environmental and health toll
          inherent in coal use.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my three-week visit to Chennai, I found much to be encouraged
          about in the city’s efforts to meet its climate and energy challenges.
          I wrote about that in this article in Fortune last year. But I also
          received a first-hand perspective on both of these most groups from
          Vishvaja Sambath, then a 29-year-old climate activist.
        </p>
        <p>
          In her day job she works at a non-profit group focused on health and
          environment issues, particularly in the communities of the city’s
          industrialized north, where several coal-fired power plants are
          located. Sambath, a leader in a local youth organization known as the
          Chennai Climate Action Group, gave me what she calls a “toxic tour” of
          the most environmentally devastated parts of the city. The tour, which
          group members conduct upon request many times a year, offers a small
          window on the conditions residents of the area live with every hour of
          every day — through the eyes of a young person concerned about their
          own future if India’s deep dependence on coal continues.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the second of three posts looking at India’s double-edged
          relationship with coal, which causes profound health problems and
          environmental destruction even as it provides some two thirds of the
          energy that enables India’s remarkable economic growth and development
          since independence. In Goa, we examined the damage that transporting
          coal from ports to steel mills causes. In this post we’ll look at the
          ravages that burning coal to produce electricity has caused in one of
          India’s fastest growing cities. Later, we’ll look at the damage coal
          mining has caused, and, paradoxically, the social damage its eventual
          demise could cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We are entering into an industrial area,” Sambath told me as we began
          our excursion. “People here are exposed to toxic chemicals. They
          breathe this in every single second of every day, this toxic air.
          While we are in that zone, we are exposed to it, too. That’s why we
          call it a ‘toxic tour.’”

          The northern extreme of Chennai has hosted multiple coal-fired power
          plants over the years, run by the state government, local companies
          and the national power provider. Sambath’s interest in the area grows
          from her work both in health care and as climate activist. On the
          climate front, Chennai is home for one of India’s most dynamic youth
          movements. The Chennai Climate Action Group started in 2019 amid the
          global movement sparked by Greta Thunberg’s call for young people
          worldwide to push for a more forceful response to climate change.
        </p>
        <p>
          A core group of young people started with a bicycle rally that year,
          and then a beach rally a few months later. The beach rally started at
          6 am on a Sunday morning — not exactly the most convenient timing for
          most people. They were expecting only about 300 people to attend. More
          than 1,500 people of all ages turned out.
        </p>
        <p>
          “It was very surprising for us. The reception from the public was
          huge. We decided we can’t stop here,” she said.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group has organized several other rallies since, including a
          rain-soaked gathering in 2021 that came to be known as the “umbrella
          rally.” Last December, the group held another major demonstration,
          this time bringing together a collection of other groups focused on
          climate action in the city.

          Our tour took us through a landscape that is hard to describe as
          anything other than dystopian. The history of Chennai — formerly known
          as Madras, the first major British foothold in India — is essentially
          one of man’s meddling with the area’s extensive wetlands.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the damage really took hold with the arrival of coal-fired power
          plants in the latter half of the 20th century and into the 2000s.
          India’s economy was taking off, and Chennai has been one of India’s
          most dynamic manufacturing and technology hubs. The areas surrounding
          the city are dotted with auto factories and software outsourcing
          operations attracting waves of migrant workers to the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          Demand for electricity has doubled and doubled again, and coal-fired
          plants were built to meet it. All of them were placed in the poorer
          northern section of the city, where our tour took place.
        </p>
        <p>
          We drove through vast, spoiled areas where the fly ash, a residue from
          combusted coal, was everywhere. Some of it was deliberately deposited
          — legally, but with profound environmental destruction nonetheless —
          but much of it also leaked illegally from the pipes and trucks
          transporting it.
        </p>

          Beyond the destruction of thousands of acres of mangrove wetland —
          which, as we’ve seen, could be absorbing atmospheric carbon and
          providing a barrier of protection against rising sea levels and
          stronger and more frequent cyclones — the fishing communities that
          once thrived on these once-robust inland waterways have suffered the
          most.
        </p>
        <p>
          Poor and politically powerless, they’ve confronted decades of air and
          water pollution from the coal generators nearby.

        <p>
          Sambath introduced me to Kumaresan, a 45 year-old resident of Ennore.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was born here. When the first coal-fired power plant arrived and
          began dumping ash directly into the waterways, it was alarming but
          didn’t change life much at first. Then another plant was built and the
          problems began to mount: cancers, skin diseases, heart issues,
          respiratory ailments, fertility maternity challenges, mental health
          problems. Children have been especially hard hit, including his own
          teenage son, who died of bone cancer several years back.
        </p>
        <p>
          “The land, water and air — it’s all been polluted,” he told us,
          standing beside a fetid waterway next to one of the 32 villages in the
          area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sambath noted the contrast with the economically dynamic southern part
          of Chennai. “For the other part of Chennai to develop, Ennore is like
          a colony where we are extracting important resources. We get drinking
          water from here, petroleum products and electricity. We get a lot from
          here. It’s why the other side of Chennai is flourishing.”
        </p>

        <p>There are few winners in the kingdom of coal.</p>
        <p>
          We’ve looked at the burdens India’s heavy coal use places on its
          people, here and here. Now we look at coal-dependent communities
          themselves, where the challenge is not just coal today but also what
          happens when coal goes away.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the eastern Indian district of Angul, among India’s first and most
          productive coal mining regions, that day admittedly may be far the
          future. The district’s five mining operations unearthed almost 100
          million metric tons of coal last year, more than a tenth of India’s
          total. Last summer my travels took me to Talcher, where the first
          underground mine in the area was dug more than a century ago. It’s the
          biggest city in the Angul district. The roads were chock-a-block with
          trucks ferrying coal from mines to rail cars, from mines to electric
          power generation plants, from mines to steel mills — all desperately
          trying to keep up with the country’s growing demand for energy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Demand is even higher this year, the scramble for coal even more
          intense. India’s electricity consumption has climbed at a double digit
          pace so far this spring. It’s turning out to be even warmer, even
          earlier than last year, when India experienced the hottest spring in a
          century. But it’s not just the heat waves, which boost air
          conditioning use, that are driving up consumption. India has a growing
          population that will become the world’s largest this year, and an
          expanding industrial base. Both have Indian authorities hustling, year
          after year, to find more fuel. By short-term necessity and long-term
          habit, they lean heavily on coal.
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd12a7a69-66ea-428d-b3e4-0fc050f81d88_5472x3648.jpeg"

        <br></br>
        <p>
          And yet, coal use must wind down if India and the world are to meet
          their decarbonization goals. The only viable, long-term solution is
          continuing to accelerate the use of renewable energy, particularly
          solar, which luckily is already cheaper than coal almost everywhere in
          India. That doesn’t mean coal can be gotten rid of overnight, or even
          in decades if you ask the Indian government. But as renewables
          continue gaining momentum, especially when partnered with energy
          storage systems, coal will wind down. The stage is being set with
          India’s target of drawing half its electricity from renewable sources
          by 2030. The upshot: If some long term planning for coal’s demise
          isn’t undertaken, then coal country — concentrated in the eastern
          states of Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal — will be
          plagued as much by the disappearance of coal as by the presence of it
          now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Caught in this paradox are communities such as those in Angul. Like
          many mining dependent regions globally, compared to the rest of the
          country locals receive disproportionately few benefits from the coal
          that’s unearthed here. Nearly all of it is shipped elsewhere in India,
          along with the profits and economic growth it helps deliver. Coal
          mining states are among the least developed in India. Their
          communities suffer from diseases and environmental contamination, and
          from the social fallout caused by dislocation. And yet, what little
          they do have comes largely from the coal industry — from white collar
          jobs right down to scavengers who gather lumps fallen from trucks and
          trains and sell them for cooking fuel.

          Bibhuti Bhusan Sahoo is typical in many ways. His grandfather worked
          as a lift operator in one of the first mines in Angul, an operation
          that began in 1921. During that era, before coal mining really spread,
          Sahoo’s father stayed in the nearby village and worked the family
          fields. By the time Sahoo grew up, mining had spread and the mining
          company took the land where their village, Balanda, was located.
          Families from the village received new land a few miles away,
          ironically a stone’s throw from the now depleted original mine his
          grandfather worked. Adult men were offered jobs. That’s how Sahoo,
          then 19, started work in the mining company. His family moved to New
          Balanda, a ramshackle housing development the local government
          sporadically hooked up to water and electricity as the mining company
          fitfully paid for the construction of new homes.

        <br></br>
        <p>
          Today, the homes are dilapidated and a few plots still have yet to be
          connected to services. Almost 500 families ultimately moved here from
          the original Balanda as the mine there grew through the 1990s. Sahoo
          and some of his neighbors drove me through the old village and
          surrounding area, now deeply scarred by environmentally destructive
          “open-cast” mines, where the coal is literally stripped from the
          surface. Mining companies are obligated to restore the landscape when
          the coal is depleted, but many of the mines are simply abandoned on
          the claim they’re not completely tapped. This saves on clean-up costs,
          and leaves many coal regions a toxic wasteland for decades after
          actual mining stops.

        <p>
          Yet the prospect of the end of mining also unnerves Sahoo. He worries
          the community will be left with no money to clean up an
          environmentally despoiled landscape while economic prospects shrivel
          for the generation that winds up holding the bag when the digging
          ends.

          generation, there’ll be no coal industry. What can they do?”

          Talcher was once a kingdom, albeit a small and sleepy one. It’s roots
          go all the way back to 1471. I learned this during a visit with a
          local association of truck owners.

        <p>
          The truck owners are yet another group that’s deeply dependent on the
          coal industry, even as the living they derive from it has become ever
          more precarious. They don’t drive the trucks, but rather are small
          business owners. They or their fathers used the compensation coal
          companies paid for their family land to buy a truck. Over time, some
          have fared better than others, building fleets consisting of a dozen
          or more trucks. All of the trucks transport coal all of the time.
          They’re driven by an even more vulnerable, even more dependent, cadre
          of drivers. Many of them, or their parents, were once laborers for the
          former agricultural landowners who now own the trucks. Divorced from
          this rural economy now, the whole lot of them felt disconnected from
          the community to which their families once belonged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unexpectedly, one truck owner asked if I wanted to meet the king of
          Talcher. It turns out there really still is one, the Raja of Talcher,
          Rajendra Chandra Deb Birabara Harichandan Mahapatra.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sure, I said, and thus followed a sort of mad-cap afternoon tour that
          included hobnobbing with the royalty of Talcher, such as it is these
          days.
        </p>
        <p>
          We piled into my car and headed to his palace, undergoing renovation
          about a 20 minute drive away. The trucker who invited us called
          Talcher’s nominal king — not actually a sovereign, anymore, just the
          official descendent of one — repeatedly on his mobile phone. He hadn’t
          reached him by the time we arrived. But he got out of our car, walked
          to the gate at the dilapidated palace and threw it open for us to
          pass.

          Talcher was among the almost 565 “princely states” that constituted
          much of India during the Raj, the imperial British governance
          structure that often ruled indirectly through local proxies. Talcher
          was small, at just under 400 square miles and a population in the tens
          of thousands. A few, like the state of Hyderabad with a population of
          16 million in 1947 (the year India gained independence), were larger
          than many European countries at the time. They were ultimately
          subsumed into independent India, peacefully and voluntarily with a few
          exceptions, with the royal families retaining some of their properties
          and gaining an allowance from the government for a time but ultimately
          losing the riches that went with ruling. That’s mostly led to their
          demise, other than those who have successfully turned their estates
          into plush tourist hotels or other savvy investments.

          We hung out, alone, for a while in a courtyard overgrown with
          vegetation. A dachshund was chained to a cage on the porch. The Raja
          wouldn’t be able to join us, our truck-owner guide eventually informed
          me. He said there was another place worth visiting, though.

          Back in the car, and off we drove to…Scotlandpur. Yes, that would be
          the name of the constituent country of the United Kingdom appended
          with the Hindi-language suffix “pur,” meaning “place.” It turns out
          that the Raja’s great-uncle, Promod Chandra Deb, spent time in
          Scotland and upon returning home decided his own estate reminded him
          of the Scottish highlands. So he renamed the village, still home to
          several dozen families.

          Scotlandpur palace was equally run-down, but we were received there by
          Sarat Chandra Deb, one of Promod’s grandsons. Sarat, who still lives
          in the estate with his family, guided me through the capacious rooms,
          decorated with stately photos of ancestors, and stuffed hunting
          trophies from leopards to buffalo. He shoots skeet off the front porch
          sometimes. Cows and a turkey wandered through the gardens in front.
          There was a fishing pond. There once was match-stick factory on the
          grounds, and a lawn tennis court, now overgrown.
        </p>
        <p>“Who’s here to play now, anyway?” Sarat said, wistfully.</p>

          A boulder blocked the road ahead, having crashed down moments earlier
          from the cliff above. Our car was jammed into a line of traffic that
          would now have to pass between the rock and the cliffside, where
          smaller stones were still tumbling down in a muddy landslide caused by
          the pounding monsoon rain.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the first time in my nearly six thousand mile journey around
          India, I was nervous.
        </p>
        <p>
          We weren’t quite trapped, but the path ahead of us was now narrow. The
          loose gravel still sliding onto the roadway wasn’t yet an avalanche,
          but it seemed to be gaining force. We’d been driving past landslides
          for two days at this point, some of which took road crews hours to
          clear away with heavy equipment. Others completely tore off long
          swathes of road, sending broken pieces into the valley below. There
          was no turning back.

          The jeep ahead of us darted through the opening. My driver leaned
          across the passenger seat and anxiously craned his neck to see uphill.
          Both hands stayed glued to the wheel, ready.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Ok,” he announced, a warning not a question. Stepping on the
          accelerator, his eyes switched from the cliffside to the gap in the
          roadway, then and back again to the cliffside. I braced in the back
          seat as we sped through the watery muck. We braked on the other side
          in a safer, if not exactly safe, place to continue our journey up into
          the Himalayas. Around one of the next bends a sign beside the road
          read, “Welcome to the land of Shiva.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Our climate and energy journey on this blog began at the end of
          India’s most-famous river, the Ganges, on a climate-stressed island in
          the Bay of Bengal known as Ghoramara. Now, six months later, I was
          climbing towards the source of that same river through a region
          equally under climate duress. During the intervening months I had cut
          a circular path around the Indian subcontinent by train. This was the
          last leg of the journey, taking me into the heart and soul of India —
          or at least a Hindu India that has both elevated and at times troubled
          this land.
        </p>
        <p>
          I boarded a sleeper car in the crowded train station of Howrah for the
          30-hour ride to Dehradun, in the foothills of the Himalayas.

          Two full days of driving followed, up winding switchbacks of the
          world’s highest mountains made more treacherous by the monsoon rains
          that loosen the mountainside soil, especially where it’s been degraded
          by foresting and foraging. That brought me to the footpath for
          Kedarnath Temple, one of the most popular and revered pilgrimage spots
          in a country that hosts what has to be the world’s most complicated
          and well-traveled set of pilgrimage circuits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kedarnath Temple was built at least 1,200 years ago by devotees of the
          Vedic religious sects that dominated the region below. The stone
          building sits in a gap in the mountains 11,755 feet (3,583 meters)
          above sea level. It was dedicated to Shiva, the Hindu deity most
          associated with the Himalayas. Kedarnath attracts hundreds of
          thousands of pilgrims each year, from holy ascetics to Instagramming
          teens.
        </p>
        <p>
          It provides a vantage point — literally, metaphorically, spiritually —
          to consider India. Physically, the Himalayas tower over the
          subcontinent from the north. Mythologically, they are where the
          all-important Ganges, having emerged from the toe of Vishnu and flowed
          through heavens controlled by Brahma, crash onto the head of Shiva and
          are safely disbursed by his ample, matted hair to flow on to the Bay
          of Bengal, where we began this journey . Thus, spiritually, they are
          associated with mythical Mount Kailash, the “Abode of the Gods.”

          Our climate and energy journey loosely followed the Ganges upstream as
          far as India’s capital, Delhi. From there we crossed the country’s
          northwest, proceeded down the Arabian sea coast, and cut across the
          Deccan plateau that sprawls across the interior of the subcontinent.
          We made our southernmost stop in the city of Rameshwaram, which is
          also the southernmost of the major pilgrimage sites in the Hindu
          mythological constellation. Here, the man-god Ram is said to have
          built a bridge to the island Lanka off the Indian coast to rescue his
          wife, Siti, from the clutches of the evil Ravana. The whole of India
          is sometimes referred to — including in the motto of the Geographical
          Survey of India — as the land “from the Himalayas to the Bridge.”

        <p>
          I found: India is making rapid progress installing renewable energy,
          although still falling short of its most ambitious goals and sometimes
          tempering them in the face of daunting challenges. The gyrations of
          international energy markets since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have
          led to a renewed push for coal, despite the foul air and high carbon
          emissions they produce, to shore up the country’s energy security. But
          the shock of skyrocketing global fossil fuel prices has also redoubled
          India’s determination to grow renewables faster. This month the
          government announced plans to more than triple the amount of renewable
          energy capacity commissioned for construction each year, from 15.5
          gigawatts last year to 50 gigawatts going forward. At least that much
          will be needed to reach the government’s target of half the country’s
          power coming from carbon free sources by 2030. Ultimately, the pace of
          India’s energy transition will turn on cutting the cost of energy
          storage systems — batteries, pumped water, air compressors, whatever
          works — to the point where renewables comprehensively eclipse coal.
          That juncture, already the state of play in many markets around the
          world, is only a few years away in India, as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that point India’s renewables rush will be constrained not by
          affordability, but by the social, political and economic challenges of
          a fulsome energy transition that we’ve seen so clearly on our journey.
          This includes the task of vastly expanding energy access. Indians on
          average use about a quarter the amount of an average Chinese and a
          tenth of the average American. The transition is already chafing for
          up-front financing, now dominated by a few mega-conglomerates. The
          biggest, the Adani Group, has had a rocky run of late. New foreign
          capital, however, is flowing into the breach. Canadian investor
          Brookfield Ventures just announced it will pour $1 billion into Indian
          renewables giant Avaada Energy. But what’s really needed is the
          overhaul of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and global
          multilateral lending system now being considered — one that would
          vastly increase both public and private funding for renewable energy
          in the developing world.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, as we’ve also seen, the impacts of climate change
          are proliferating everywhere in India, from the tea fields of
          Darjeeling to the deserts of Rajasthan to the mango farms on the
          Arabian Sea coast. These include a massive flood and landslide at
          Kedarnath itself, in 2013. High above the temple, a glacial lake
          formed by melting ice, swollen by unprecedented rains, burst. As many
          as 20,000-30,000 pilgrims and local residents were killed in the
          subsequent deluge. Still, no one knows exactly how many. The temple
          survived thanks to a massive boulder sitting on its uphill side that
          broke the force of the waters rushing through the valley. Landslides
          and flooding have been part of the geology of the Himalayas since they
          were formed by the upward thrust of continental plates colliding 50
          million years ago. Specific weather events cannot be definitively
          pinned on climate change, but it’s clear catastrophes such as these
          happen more often when temperatures rise. The pace of change here, in
          what’s sometimes called the world’s “third pole” is gaining speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This sort of climate fallout presents costly adaptation challenges
          that will sap money and initiative from the energy transition. India’s
          leaders focus, quite rightly, on the injustice of their vulnerability
          to a problem they’ve done little to cause. The U.S. and Europe emitted
          most of the greenhouse gasses causing the climate to change. They
          should clean-up and pay for the damage, Indians argue. They’ve
          obviously got a point and they should continue to make it. Yet
          renewables also have now become cheap enough that India can — indeed
          is — taking steps that both reduce future greenhouse gas emissions and
          boost India’s economy and development. Wind and solar growth, hydrogen
          investments, efficiency gains like India’s world-leading adoption of
          high-efficiency light bulbs all reduce global emissions and spur
          economic growth. They’re all upside for India going forward.
          Remediation of and compensation for past emissions can be a separate
          discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
          India’s climate negotiators have made even bolder proposals — floating
          the idea of phasing out of all fossil fuels at last year’s preeminant
          United Nation’s climate conference. They should re-up the idea this
          year, seizing global leadership on climate, and try to unlock a flood
          of foreign funding, I argue.
        </p>

          What could throw India off track? Many things, from its sclerotic
          legal system to its lackluster schools to its cumbersome manufacturing
          environment. And one more thing: The rising sectarian chauvinism
          encouraged by the Hindu-nationalist BJP government risks the sort of
          social and political upheaval that could derail the economy and drive
          off desperately needed foreign investment.

          The ten mile hike to the temple remained. I slept in the village of
          Gauri Kund at the bottom of the stone path to the temple and set out
          at 4 am the next morning in the dark and drizzling rain. A few hundred
          yards into my climb I met Hariharan Krishna, a pilgrim from the city
          of Madurai, where I had stopped briefly a few weeks before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hari had built a construction business in Dubai that failed during
          Covid. He returned to India and was embarked on a series of
          pilgrimages. A decade younger than my 60 years, he was climbing at the
          same steady pace up the winding, often steep incline. We agreed to
          walk together.
        </p>
        <p>
          The path was clogged with hikers and a parade of mules carrying
          supplies of food, construction materials and pilgrims. Elderly
          pilgrims and those unfit to walk or ride were carried aloft in litters
          on the shoulders of young men. Soon there were two processions, one up
          one down, moving along a path cut into the side of cliffs.
        </p>
        <p>The views were vertiginous, like nothing I’d ever experienced.</p>

          The rain and snow melting above sent cascades of water tumbling down
          on all sides. Torrents ran down the path, soaking our shoes. The peaks
          around us sported lush vegetation interspersed with exposed rock. At
          our feet the diluted excrement of mules flowed with the runoff.

          We walked, and walked more, past tea stalls and hawkers of religious
          trinkets. We stopped for samosas to keep us going, then some cucumber
          with lemon and a spicy sauce. We walked again. My legs throbbed. Hari
          urged me to think smaller, focus on each step alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Small is big,” he said, a management aphorism he’d heard and applied
          to his own life and business. Enough small change leads to big things.
          One step at a time. By this time I took every encouragement I could
          get.
        </p>
        <p>We pushed on for 12 hours, arriving at the temple before sunset.</p>

          The temple, a stocky doorstop of a building, was a hive of activity.
          Along the steps leading up to it, splayed across the wide courtyard in
          front, were vendors and merchants. Across the plaza were Sannyasis and
          Sadhus — holy men — offering blessings and consultations, their faces
          smeared white and yellow and orange and black with paste. Pilgrims
          snapped selfies and posed photos. Hari, after bathing and changing,
          was thrilled to ring the ceremonial bell to mark his arrival.

        <p>
          Vedic legend has it that after the greatest and most horrible war
          between two interrelated clans, the winning Pandava family wanted
          Shiva to cleanse them of their sins in battle. They found him hiding
          in the Himalayas, but Shiva became a bull and burrowed into the earth
          to conceal himself. The rocky outcropping of Kedarnath remains as the
          hump of his back. The Pandavas are carved into Kedarnath’s walls.
          Shiva is present in the landscape itself, not only here but throughout
          the Himalayas.
        </p>
        <p>
          I slept in a bare-bones hotel a short walk from the temple — sharing
          space with a family of mice — and returned to Kedarnath before
          sunrise. Pilgrims were already lined up in the damp, incense filled
          air. A priest poured ghee, the clarified butter Hindus use for many
          rituals, on the statue of Nandi, Shiva’s bull-deity sidekick and main
          means of transport, guarding the temple door. Awaiting them in the
          heart of the temple was the holy Linga, the smooth obelisk that
          embodies Shiva.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accompanying Shiva is Shakti, representing the primordial energy of
          the universe, what brings the elements of the universe encompassed by
          Shiva to life. No better place to conclude an energy and climate
          journey.

        Before leaving, I circled behind the temple to see the great rock that
        sheltered it from the awful torrent and landslide in 2013. The Chorabari
        Glacier still sits more than 1,000 feet above Kedarnath but has
        retreated considerably as temperatures in the Himalayas rise.

          On my way down from Kedarnath, I passed a group of young pilgrims
          batting a volleyball around to entertain themselves. I thought about
          their future.

          The path ahead is narrow. With climate change and the energy
          transition gaining force, we have to move fast. There’s no turning
          back. Hold on to your seat.
        </p>
        <p>It’s an adventure.</p>
